<p><hr></p>
<p class="p1">夜航</p>
<p class="p1">　　献给迪迪埃<span class="s1">·</span>多拉先生</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">        </span>À Monsieur Didier Daurat</p>
<p class="p1">　　《夜航》序（法）安德烈<span class="s1">·</span>纪德</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">          </span>PRÉFACE par ANDRÉ GIDE</p>
<p class="p1">　　对于航空公司而言，与其他交通工具竞争靠的是速度。这是令人钦佩的领导者里维埃（<span class="s1">Rivière</span>）在本书中所言。他说：“对我们航空公司来说，这是一个生死攸关的问题，因为我们白天对铁路和水运所取得的优势，到了晚上就会丧失殆尽。”这一夜间航班开始备受批评，后来被接受，虽然经反复冒险试验之后变得方便可行，但时至本书写作，仍然没有绝对的把握。充满变数的空中通道风险难料，夜间飞行更是神秘莫测。今天，风险仍然很大，所以我得赶紧说，它会逐日减少，每一次新的航程都会为下一次航程带来进一步的方便和保证。但是，航空事业就像开垦荒地一样，也经历英雄的初创时期，因此，《夜航》向我们描述的这些航空事业的先驱者可歌可泣的事迹，自然而然地具有史诗般的意义。</p>
<p class="p1">　　我喜欢圣<span class="s1">-</span>埃克絮佩里的第一本书，但是，我更喜欢现在的这一本。在《南方邮政飞机》（<span class="s1">Courrier Sud</span>）中，飞行员准确、扣人心弦的回忆与情感故事融为一体，把我们与主人公的距离拉近。主人公富含感情，啊！真让我们感到他有人情味，又显得懦弱。《夜航》的主人公显然不是不近人情，而是具有非凡的美德。我认为，这部令人震撼的小说特别令我喜欢的是它描写了人的高尚情操。人的弱点、懒散、堕落，我们已经了解得够多，当今的文学将之讨伐又太拿手。但是，靠坚强的意志，就能超越自我，这正是特别需要有人向我们宣示的。</p>
<p class="p1">　　在我看来，比飞行员的形象更令人震撼的就是他的上司里维埃。里维埃并不是自己做事，而是指挥别人做事，把他的道德标准灌输给飞行员，要求他们最大限度地干好，促使他们建功立业。他冷酷的决定容不得软弱，任何闪失都要受到他的惩罚。初次接触会觉得他的严厉不人道，太过分。但是他的严厉只对不完善的事而不对人。他要把人磨炼出来。通过这一刻画，我们可以感到作者的钦佩之情。人的幸福不在于享有自由而在于承担责任。这个充满矛盾的真理对我来说具有重大的心理学意义。我特别感激作者阐释了这个真理。这本小说的每一个人物都是满腔热情、全身心地投入他们应该做的工作，投身充满危险的任务。只有完成了这个任务，他们才会找到幸福的所在。大家都看得到．里维埃绝不是冷血人，（最令人动容的莫过于对他接待失踪者妻子的描述）比起他手下的飞行员执行命令，他更需要勇气给他们下达命令。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>要想让别人喜欢自己，<span class="s1">"</span>他说，<span class="s1">"</span>只需表达同情就行。我根本不会表达同情，或者说我把同情隐藏起来<span class="s1">……</span>有时我对自己的权力之大感到惊讶。<span class="s1">"</span>他还说：<span class="s1">"</span>爱您对之发号施令的人，但不要明说。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　左右里维埃的也是对责任所表现出的感情，<span class="s1">"</span>对一种责任有说不清的感情，比爱的感情更伟大<span class="s1">"</span>。愿人人不要追求个人目的，而应服从并献身于主宰和依赖他的事业。我要在此重拾这一<span class="s1">"</span>说不清的感情<span class="s1">"</span>，是它让我的普罗米修斯自相矛盾地说：<span class="s1">"</span>我不喜欢人，而喜欢充溢人的激情。<span class="s1">"</span>这便是任何英雄主义的源泉。<span class="s1">"</span>我们在行动，<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃想，<span class="s1">"</span>就像某件东西在价值上超过人的生命<span class="s1">……</span>但这东西是什么呢？<span class="s1">"</span>还说：<span class="s1">"</span>也许有某种别的东西要拯救，是更持久的东西；也许要拯救的就是里维埃研究的人的这一部分。<span class="s1">"</span>我们应该相信这一点。</p>
<p class="p1">　　既然男人的勇气在化学家让人们感到恐惧的未来战争中可能无用武之地，英雄主义就会离军队而去。在这种时候，难道不是在航空事业中我们能够看到勇气得到最令人赞叹、最充分的施展吗？一般认为莽撞之事，在一个有指挥的服务中就不会出现。不停地冒生命危险的飞行员，听到我们通常对勇气的看法，多少会有权发笑。圣<span class="s1">-</span>埃克絮佩里会允许我举出他的一封已经很旧的信为例的，这封信是在他担负卡萨布兰卡<span class="s1">-</span>达喀尔航线飞行任务时飞经毛里塔尼亚写的。信是这样说的：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我不知道什么时候能回家，这几个月我的工作太多了，要寻找失踪的同事、抢修摔落抵抗区的飞机，以及一些飞往达喀尔的飞机。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我刚刚立了一个小功，花两天两夜的时间与十一个摩尔人和一个机械师一起，救了一架飞机。当时危险四伏，问题严重。我第一次听到子弹从头顶呼啸而过。后来我终于懂得自己在这种气氛中的表现：比摩尔人还要冷静。但是，我虽然明白，却一直让我惊讶，为什么柏拉图（还是亚里士多德呢？）会把勇气摆在德行的末位。这勇气也不是什么很美好的情操，只不过是一点儿狂热、一点儿虚荣、十分顽强以及平常的体育兴趣合成罢了。特别是与勇气无关的体力的亢奋。敞开衬衣，交叉双臂，呼吸就会顺畅，或者说更惬意。这事要是发生在夜晚，就会有一种做了天大蠢事的感觉。我再也不会欣赏一个仅仅勇敢的人。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　我可以引用坎通（<span class="s1">Quinton</span>）在一本书里的格言，作上述信件的开头引语，尽管我一直不同意他的观点<span class="s1">:</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>人们常常将勇敢隐藏起采，就像隐藏爱意一样。<span class="s1">"</span>或者更精彩：<span class="s1">"</span>勇敢的人隐瞒自己的行为，就像老实人隐瞒他们给别人的施舍一样。他们将之伪装起来，或者婉言推脱。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　圣<span class="s1">-</span>埃克絮佩里在书中所讲述的，都是以<span class="s1">"</span>了解的事实<span class="s1">"</span>为基础。他常常面对艰危，他的亲身经历赋予了他的书一种真实的、独一无二的韵味。我们有很多臆想的战争小说或冒险小说，作者使尽了浑身解数，其实，真正的冒险家读了，只会发笑。这本我欣赏其文学价值的小说，也有资料价值，两种优点融为一体，密不可分，使《夜航》具有极其重要的地位。</p>
<p class="p1">　　一</p>
<p class="p1">　　飞机下，山丘已经在金黄的暮色中被印上一道道阴影。平原一片灿烂，夕阳的余辉经久不散。在这个国家里，大地永远不知疲倦地泛着金光，一如入冬之后，处处银装素裹，冰雪茫茫。</p>
<p class="p1">　　飞行员法比安驾驶着邮政飞机，从最南端的巴塔戈尼亚飞往布宜诺斯艾利斯。往下看，只见港湾的水面一平如镜，只有阵阵涟漪映照出静静的云彩。看见这种景象，他知道夜晚临近了。他仿佛驶进一个惬意舒心的宽阔锚地。</p>
<p class="p1">　　在这片寂静中，他真以为自己是在悠然漫步，差不多就像一个牧羊人似的。巴塔戈尼亚的牧羊人总是不慌不忙地从一群羊走到另一群羊里去，而他则从一座城市飞到另一座城市去。他就是放牧这些小城市的牧羊人。每隔两个小时，他就会遇到一些这样的城市，它们像羊群一样，有的在河边饮水，有的在平原上吃草。</p>
<p class="p1">　　有时候，经过百来公里的飞行，越过比大海更苍凉的草原，他会遇上一座与世隔绝的农庄，仿佛一条承载人的生命的船只，在大浪滔天的草海中，被向后卷去。于是，他摆动机翼，向这条船致意。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>圣胡安已经进入视线，十分钟后可降落。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　机组报务员把这条消息发往航线上的各个指挥塔。</p>
<p class="p1">　　从麦哲伦海峡到布宜诺斯艾利斯，两千五百公里的航程上，类似的中途站一个接着一个，但是这一个中途站就处在夜的疆界，如同在非洲，经过最后一个归顺的村庄，便进入神秘的疆土。</p>
<p class="p1">　　报务员把一张纸条递给驾驶员，纸条上写着：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>雷雨太大，耳机里听到的尽是放电声。您在圣胡安过夜吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　法比安笑了笑。天空宁静得像个金鱼缸，而且前面每个中途站都如此，他们纷纷报告：<span class="s1">"</span>晴空，无风。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　但他却回答说：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>咱们继续往前飞。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　可是报务员认为暴风雨已经藏在某个角落里，就像虫子钻进了果子里一样。夜色虽美，但要变天的，他可不愿意闯进眼看就要变糟的黑夜中。</p>
<p class="p1">　　法比安减速，向圣胡安降落。他感到了倦意。房屋，小咖啡馆，供人休闲散步的树林，所有这些让人类生活甜蜜的东西，在他的下面逐渐变大。他像个征战的胜利者，在凯旋之夜俯视着自己帝国的大地，发现人们过着的是小康的生活。法比安需要休息调整，认真体验人在疲倦的时候一身笨重、四肢酸痛的感受。在这儿住下，做个普通人，看看窗外静止的景物，即使贫穷，精神上也会是富有的。哪怕住在这个小小的村子，他也会同意。人经过挑选住下来，就会随遇而安，会喜欢上它的，它会像爱情一样把人圈住。法比安真想在这儿长住下去，成为这儿永久居民的一分子，因为，他生活过一个钟头的这些市镇、他穿过的这些古墙环绕的花园仿佛是永恒的，久久地存在于他的身外。村子迎着飞机扑来，朝着他敞开胸怀。法比安想到了友情，想到柔情似水的少女，想到温馨的白桌布，想到一切慢慢化作永恒的东西。村子贴着机翼向后退避，给人展示大门紧闭的花园的奥秘，即使有古墙围绕也枉然。但是，法比安着陆后，除了墙内有几个人缓慢移动之外，他什么也看不到。村子昂然屹立，一动不动，守卫着自己情感的秘密，不轻易给人温暖，要想享受它的温暖，必须放弃飞行。</p>
<p class="p1">　　十分钟的停站时间过去，法比安又得继续飞了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他回头看了圣胡安一眼，见到的只不过是一片灯光，然后是一颗颗的星星，最后剩下一粒吸引着他不忍离去的尘埃，然后连这也散去了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我再也看不见仪表板，所以开灯了。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他按了开关，座舱里的红灯与座舱外射进的蓝光都很暗，无法照亮指针。他把手指放在一只灯泡上，指头几乎没有颜色。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>太早了。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　然而夜色像一团黑烟升起来，把整个山谷笼罩，让人分不清哪儿是山谷，哪儿是平原。一条条村子已亮起了灯光，与天上的灿烂群星遥相呼应。他也用手打开标示飞机位置的闪烁灯，回应这些村子的灯光。大地布满了呼应的亮光，家家户户在茫茫的黑夜里点亮了自家的灯光，远看下去宛如一颗颗星星，像是把灯塔指向大海。凡是有人生活的地方都一片亮堂。法比安这次飞进黑夜，就像是船舶进入锚地，慢慢地，美美地，令他欣喜不已。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他一头钻进驾驶舱。荧光指针亮了起来。这位飞行员逐个检查各种数据，感到很满意。他发现自己已经稳稳当当地坐在天空上。他用手指轻轻抚摩钢翼梁，感觉到这金属有生命，它不是在震颤，而是在呼吸。五百匹马力的发动机产生了一股静静的电流，传遍整个机身，把冰冷的钢铁变成了天鹅绒般的血肉之躯。他在飞行中没有觉得眩晕、陶醉，而是又一次感到这个有血有肉的生命所做的工作神秘莫测。</p>
<p class="p1">　　如今，他为自己打拼出了一个新天地，他舞动肘子，左推右挡，要在这一片天地中找个舒适的位置安顿下来。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他轻轻敲一敲配电盘，逐个打开开关，动了动身子，靠好靠背，寻找最佳位置，来好好领略这夜空托起的五吨重的金属的摆动。接着，他摸索着把救急灯推到合适的位置，松开手，又重新抓住，确信它没有滑动，才又放开手，去轻摸每根手柄。要一伸手肯定能摸着，训练手指熟悉在这个看不见的世界里如何进行操作。然后，等手指很熟练了，他才允许自己打开一盏灯，照亮驾驶室里各种精确的仪器，这样，仅仅靠仪表盘的指引，就像跳水一样，一头扎进黑夜里。最后，看到任何指针都不摆动，都不颤动，都不抖动，方向仪、高程计、发动机的运转，全都正常，他才伸了一下身子，把脖子靠在座椅的皮面上，开始了对飞行的沉思遐想，从中品味那充满不可言传的希望的乐趣。</p>
<p class="p1">　　现在，在这黑夜的深处，他像个守夜人，发现夜色可以把人的一切展现出来，听到那呼唤声，看到那灯火，又受到那焦虑的煎熬。那颗黑影中的星星却是一间孤独的屋子。一颗星星熄灭了，那意味着一座屋子把自己的爱锁住。</p>
<p class="p1">　　或者把自己的烦恼锁住。可是，这屋子却不再向外界发出信号。灯下，那些农民把双肘支在桌子上，不知道他们的希望何在，不知道在这笼罩着他们的黑夜里，他们的心愿传得有多远。但是，当法比安来自千里之外，感到汹涌的大浪正把他那会呼吸的飞机举起、放下的时候；当他像穿越战乱之地一样经历十次风暴，或者在风暴的间隙皓月当空的时候；当他满怀胜利的喜悦逐个飞临片片灯海的时候，他发现了农民的心愿。这些农民的灯光只照亮简陋的桌子，殊不知，在八千米的高空，已经有人被灯光的召唤所感动，仿佛他们置身于大海中的一座孤岛，正绝望地摇晃这灯光。</p>
<p class="p1">　　二</p>
<p class="p1">　　就这样，三架邮政飞机分别从南部的巴塔戈尼亚、西部的智利和北部的巴拉圭返回布宜诺斯艾利斯。这儿，人们正在等着它们运来的邮件，以便装上午夜时分飞往欧洲的航班。</p>
<p class="p1">　　三架飞机的驾驶员，坐在驳船般沉重的发动机罩后面，对着茫茫黑夜反思他们的航程。飞机飞临这座巨大的城市上方，冲出雷雨交加或是碧空如洗的天空，徐徐降落，如同一些古怪的农民从他们的山上下来一样。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃是整个航空网络的负责人，他正在布宜诺斯艾利斯机场的停机坪上来回踱步。他沉默不语，因为在这三架飞机到达之前，他的这一天总是担惊受怕的。时间一分钟一分钟过去，随着电报一封一封交到他手里，他才意识到自己同命运的争斗中赢得了一点什么，未知的事越来越明朗，他的那些机组正在无边的黑夜里被拉回岸边。</p>
<p class="p1">　　一个工人来到里维埃跟前，将无线电站收到的消息转交给他：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>从智利飞来的邮政飞机报告已经看到布宜诺斯艾利斯的灯光。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>好的。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　不久，里维埃就听到这架飞机的声音。黑夜已经将一架飞机送回来，就像潮起潮落、神秘莫测的大海将漂浮多时的宝物送回海滩一样。过不了多久，另外两架飞机也要到达了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　到了那会儿，这一天才算了结，劳累的机组人员就要去睡觉，另一个精神饱满的机组接替他们。但是里维埃根本无法休息，飞往欧洲的飞机接着又要让他心神不定了。他永远就这样忙活。永远。这位老斗士惊讶平生第一次感到疲乏。飞机一架一架地到达，这绝不是那种结束一场战争、开创和平美满新纪元的胜利，而对他来说只是千百步中迈出的一步。里维埃觉得自己一直在张开双臂，力挺重担，但这是一种得不到休息、看不到希望的努力。<span class="s1">"</span>我老了<span class="s1">……"</span>如果他不能在工作中得到养料，他真的会老的。他思考起一些从未思索过的问题，他对此感到惊奇。然而，他一直极力回避的柔情蜜意，随着<span class="s1">"</span>这是一片失去的海洋<span class="s1">"</span>的忧郁的嗫嚅声涌上心头。<span class="s1">"</span>这一切难道就这么近吗？<span class="s1">……"</span>他发觉自己已经将那使人的生活变得甜蜜的事业一步一步地推向晚年，推向<span class="s1">"</span>他有时间的时候<span class="s1">"</span>，好像人有朝一日真的有时间，在晚年的时候真的能够过上想象中的和平幸福的生活一样。但是，和平幸福是不存在的，胜利也许也不会来临，邮政飞机到达的时间也不确定。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃来到正在干活的老工长勒鲁跟前。勒鲁也已经干了四十年了。工作耗费了他的全部精力。晚上十点或是半夜他回家的时候，展现在他的面前的不是另一个天地，不是一个安宁的避风港。里维埃对着勒鲁微笑，这汉子抬起凝重的脸，指着一根泛蓝的钢轴说：<span class="s1">"</span>这玩意儿拧得太紧，不过我调整好了。<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃朝钢轴俯下身子，又被老本行吸引住了。<span class="s1">"</span>得告诉车间别把配件装得太紧。<span class="s1">"</span>他用手指抚摩机器被卡住留下的痕迹，然后又打量勒鲁。面对勒鲁满脸深深的皱纹，一个滑稽的问题到了嘴边，连他也觉得好笑：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>勒鲁，你这辈子花很多时间谈情说爱吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>噢，经理先生，您知道，爱这东西<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>您跟我一样，从来都没有工夫顾及。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>确实没有太多<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃倾听这句话的音调，了解答语是不是含有苦涩。这句话语并不苦涩。这汉子面对过去的日子，有一种恬静的满足感，仿佛是一个木工刚刚刨出一块漂亮的木板，说：<span class="s1">"</span>好，行了。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>好的，<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃想，<span class="s1">"</span>我这辈子就这样了。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他抛开这些因劳累而生出的伤感想法，朝飞机库走去。从智利来的飞机已经在轰鸣。</p>
<p class="p1">　　三</p>
<p class="p1">　　远处的那台发动机的声音越响越密，像果子一样成熟了。灯亮了。红彤彤的航标灯勾勒出机库、无线电天线杆和正方形的机场。一片节庆的景象。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>飞机已经飞临机场上空了！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　飞机已经进入探照灯交叉照射的光束里，灿烂夺目，跟新的一样。但是当飞机终于在机库前停稳、机械师和工人忙着卸邮件的时候，飞行员贝勒兰却呆在驾驶座上一动不动。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>怎么啦？您还不下来，在等什么呢？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　飞行员在忙着做着什么神秘的事儿，不屑作答。他也许还在倾听掠过他脑海里的飞机声。他慢慢摇着头、身子往前倾斜，不知在摆弄着什么玩意儿。最后，他才把头转向上司和同事们，神情严肃地看着他们，像是在巡视自己的产业。他仿佛是逐个数着他们，丈量他们的高度，给他们称体重。他想他结结实实地赢得了他们，赢得了这座充满生机、美女如云、洋溢着温暖的城市。他把这些人掌握在大手中，像自己的臣民，因为他可以触摸他们、倾听他们说话，甚至骂他们几句。他起初想骂他们，因为他们悠然自得地呆着，活得有滋有味，还有闲心欣赏如水的月光。但是他还是宽厚地说：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"……</span>还不请我喝一杯！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　于是他走下飞机。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他想把旅途见闻告诉他们。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>要是你们知道<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他也许觉得说这些已经够了，便脱下皮衣，走了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　当汽车载着他和一位没精打采的督察以及默不作声的里维埃前往布宜诺斯艾利斯的时候，他变得忧伤起来。完成艰难的飞行任务，安全着陆，身体无恙，松弛松弛，高兴还能骂上几句，真不错。这是多么带劲的乐事啊！但是过后回想起一路上的经历，心里真有点不踏实。</p>
<p class="p1">　　与狂风搏斗，这件事起码是实实在在的，毋庸置疑。不过有些事情<span class="s1">--</span>你没有亲身经历过的事情的真相可就不是这样了。他心里想：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>那狂风简直就像是暴动一样，暴动者的脸色倒不怎么发白，却变化莫测。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他极力回忆当时的情景。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他平安地飞越安第斯山脉，冬天的积雪静静地覆盖其上。</p>
<p class="p1">　　积雪使群山一片宁静，如同岁月让古堡沉睡。绵延二百公里的雪山上，见不到一个人，听不到生命的气息，也没有人试图来到这儿，唯有六千米高的峭壁、直泻而下的面幔和令人发怵的寂静。</p>
<p class="p1">　　那是在图彭加托山的附近<span class="s1">……</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他想了一会儿。对，就在那儿，他见证了一出奇观。</p>
<p class="p1">　　起初，他什么也没有看见，只是觉得不自在，好像一个人自以为只身一人，却并非孤身独处，而是被别人盯着一样。他当时感到怒气冲天，只是发现这种感觉为时过晚，人也不明白到底是怎么回事。事情经过就是这样。可是这怒气从哪儿来呢？</p>
<p class="p1">　　他凭什么猜想这怒气是从石头里、从雪堆中冒出来的呢？因为好像并没有什么是冲着他来的，也没有黑云压顶的风暴刮起来啊！而只是在原来的位置上现出了一个稍有不同的另一个天地罢了。贝勒兰看看这些无辜的山崖、这些覆盖灰白积雪的山脊和山峰，心里莫名其妙地不安起来。然而这儿却开始有了人气<span class="s1">--</span>像是来了一群人。</p>
<p class="p1">　　其实并不需要进行什么搏斗，他的手却紧紧抓住操纵杆。好像正在酝酿什么，但他却全然不知。他绷紧全身的肌肉，活像一头准备起跳的野兽。但是他并没有看见什么不平静的东西。是呀，平静得很，只是平静中隐藏着一种怪异的力量，随时要爆发出来。</p>
<p class="p1">　　接着，一切变得更加尖利，这些山脊，这些山峰，一个个变得尖利起来，像船桅尖插入劲风中。后来，它们仿佛在他的四周弯来拐去，不断漂移，像是一支庞大的舰队进入战斗状态。而后，空气夹带着尘埃，像一层轻纱，慢慢沿着积雪升腾，徐徐地飘荡。于是，为了留条退路，以便必要时后撤，他回过头去，身子不由得抖起来，因为整个安第斯山脉在他后面沸腾。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我完了。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　前面的一座山大雪纷飞，那是一座积雪的火山。然后又是另一座山峰，稍稍靠右。就这样，所有的山峰一座接一座进发出火花，像是被某个隐身的运动员点燃。就在这时，随着第一拨气流的掀起，群山在飞行员四周摇晃起来。</p>
<p class="p1">　　激烈的搏斗没有留下什么印记，甚至把他掀翻的巨大气流他也回忆不起来，只记得自己陷进灰色的火焰中拼命地挣扎。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他思考着。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>飓风也没有什么大不了的，人还是保住了自己的性命。然而，从前可不一样了！而这次是碰上了！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他以为在千百张脸孔中认出了某一张脸孔，然而他却已经把这张脸孔忘得一干二净了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　四</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃看着贝勒兰。再过二十分钟，这位飞行员就要下车，带着倦意和沉睡融人人海中。他也许会想：<span class="s1">"</span>真累人<span class="s1">……</span>这讨厌的行当！<span class="s1">"</span>对妻子他会坦陈某些事，比如：<span class="s1">"</span>这儿比安第斯山脉上空好多了。<span class="s1">"</span>然而，人十分珍惜的一切几乎都已离他而去，他刚刚吃过了这种苦头，在另一个世界度过了几个小时，当时根本就不知道是否还能够重睹这座灯火璀璨的城市，甚至也不知道能否再找到那些与生俱来的弱点<span class="s1">--</span>既令人讨厌又十分可亲的朋友。<span class="s1">"</span>在所有的人群中，<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃心想，<span class="s1">"</span>总有些不引人注目的人，他们都是非同凡响的信使，而他们并不知道自己扮演了这种角色<span class="s1">……</span>起码<span class="s1">……"</span>里维埃害怕某些崇拜者，他们不理解这些有着非凡经历的神圣，他们的赞叹声往往曲解了这些经历的含义，到头来反而把人贬低了。但是，贝勒兰却完整地保持了他的伟大，原因只有一个，那就是他比任何人更懂得在某种角度下看到的这个世界的真正价值，对这些赞词不屑一顾。因此，里维埃祝贺他：<span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"</span>你成功的人生是怎样拼出来的？<span class="s1">"</span>他喜欢他谈论自己的职业时那种淡泊的态度，说起飞行的经历就像铁匠说自己的铁砧板一样。</p>
<p class="p1">　　贝勒兰首先解释自己已无退路。他几乎像是在道歉：<span class="s1">"</span>就这样，我没有选择的余地。<span class="s1">"</span>接着，他什么也看不见了，大雪把他的眼睛蒙住了。但是，猛烈的气流把他托到了七千米的高度，救了他一命。<span class="s1">"</span>在飞越山脉的整个过程中，我大概是贴着山脊飞行的。<span class="s1">"</span>他也提到陀螺仪，飞雪把进气口堵住了，得给它换个位置。<span class="s1">"</span>瞧，会结冰的。<span class="s1">"</span>过了一会儿，另一股气流直把贝勒兰的飞机吹得上下起伏，落到了三千米左右，他不明白为何一点儿什么也没有撞上。原来是他已经飞临平原上空。<span class="s1">"</span>我进入晴朗的天空时才猛然发现这一点。<span class="s1">"</span>他最后说，那会儿他的感觉像是从地洞里钻出来。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>门多萨那儿也有暴风雪吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>没有。我着陆时天空晴朗，一丝风也没有。不过暴风雪紧紧跟随着我。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他之所以描述这场风暴，按他的说法，那是因为<span class="s1">"</span>这毕竟很奇特<span class="s1">"</span>。风暴的上端嵌人雪花纷飞的云层，而底部却像黑色的岩浆在平原上翻滚。城市一座接一座被包裹起来。<span class="s1">"</span>我从未见过这样的奇观<span class="s1">……"</span>后来，他想起什么，默不作声了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃转身对督察员说：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>这是太平洋的飓风，我们接到通知太迟了，这类飓风从来都不超出安第斯山范围。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>大家都没有料到，这次飓风会向东移动。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　督察员对此一窍不通，只有表示赞同。</p>
<p class="p1">　　督察员像是犹豫了一下，才向贝勒兰转过身来，喉结动了，但没有说话。他思考片刻，两眼直视前方，才恢复了忧郁的尊严。这忧郁，像一件行李，总是陪伴着他游走四方。他昨天夜里才到达阿根廷，里维埃便召他来办些杂事，他的一双大手不知如何是好，督察员的尊严也拉不下。他没有权利与别人喝一杯，也不能与同事称兄道弟，说句俏皮话，除非是碰巧在同一个中途站遇上了另一位督察员。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>做个裁判真不近人情。<span class="s1">"</span>他想。</p>
<p class="p1">　　说实话，他并不作出裁决，而只是摇晃脑袋。他什么都不懂，遇到任何事情，他都是慢条斯理地摇晃脑袋。这样倒好，那些黑心肠的人，反而给镇住了，机器设备也就保养好了。他并不讨人喜欢，因为督察员这个岗位不是为了博得爱戴才设立的，而是专打小报告的。自从里维埃写下<span class="s1">"</span>请督察员鲁比诺向我们提供报告，而不是诗句。督察员鲁比诺应该充分发挥自己的才干，调动工作人员的积极性<span class="s1">"</span>这句话之后，他就不再提出新方法和解决技术问题的建议了。从此往后，他就像每天管吃饭一样，只管工作人员有什么过失，比如机械师贪杯、机场场长整夜不眠、飞行员着陆不平稳。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃谈到他的时候说：<span class="s1">"</span>他人不是很聪明，正因为这样他的工作反而更出色。<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃订出的规章制度，对他自己来说，是出于对大家的了解；而对于鲁比诺来说，却只剩下对制度本身的了解了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>鲁比诺，<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃有一天对他说，<span class="s1">"</span>所有不正点起飞的飞机，您都应该扣掉他们的准点奖。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>遇上不可抗拒力也扣吗？连大雾不能起飞也扣？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>就算遇上大雾也扣。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　鲁比诺为自己有一个办事不怕不公正的得力领导感到自豪。他自己会从这种咄咄逼人的权力中汲取几分威严。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>你们六点十五分才发出起飞指令，<span class="s1">"</span>他后来对机场负责人反复地说，<span class="s1">"</span>我们不能给你们发奖金。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>可是，鲁比诺先生，五点三十分的时候连十米远的地方也看不到啊！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>这是规章制度。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>可是，鲁比诺先生，我们总不能把大雾清扫掉吧！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　鲁比诺摆出一副高深莫测的样子。他是领导成员之一。在这些没有主见的人当中，唯有他懂得怎样通过惩罚手段提高飞机的准点率。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>他什么也不考虑，<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃评价他说，<span class="s1">"</span>这样可以使他避免考虑不周出差错。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　如果一个飞行员损坏飞机，他就会丢掉机器设备完好奖。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>如果飞机在森林上空发生故障呢？<span class="s1">"</span>鲁比诺想打听此事。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>在森林上空也一样。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　于是鲁比诺就以此为依据。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我很遗憾，<span class="s1">"</span>后来他十分亢奋地对飞行员说，<span class="s1">"</span>我甚至十二万分遗憾，但是，故障得在别的地方发生。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>可是，鲁比诺先生，这由不得我们啊！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>这是规章制度。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>规章制度，<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃想，<span class="s1">"</span>这规章制度就像宗教仪式，乍一看有点儿荒谬，但可以重塑人的形象。<span class="s1">"</span>公正不公正，对于里维埃来说都无所谓。这些话对他甚至没有意义。小城市里的小市民晚上都围着露天音乐厅转。于是，里维埃又想：<span class="s1">"</span>对他们公正或者不公正，这完全没有意义，因为他们并不存在。<span class="s1">"</span>对他来说，人就是一团生蜡，需要加以揉捏，要给予这块料一个灵魂，创造一个意志。他并不想用这种生活的态度让大家服服帖帖，而是要他们超越自我。如果说他这样严厉惩罚晚点有失公正，但他却是要让每个中途站有一种准点起飞的愿望，他要创造这种愿望。他不允许大家看到天气坏了，可以休息了而高兴起来，他要让大家常备不懈，甚至最不起眼的工人也因为无所事事而感到羞耻。这样，人们就会抓住大雾的间隙起飞。<span class="s1">"</span>北面亮了，出发！<span class="s1">"</span>在里维埃的努力下，在一万五千公里的航线上，人们对邮政飞机的崇拜高于一切。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃有时会这样说：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>这些人是幸福的，因为他们热爱自己的工作；他们热爱自己的工作，因为我铁面无私。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他也许让大家吃了苦头，但也带来了莫大的快乐。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>必须推他们一把，<span class="s1">"</span>他想，<span class="s1">"</span>让他们过一种奋发向上的生活，生活中有苦也有乐，唯有这样生活才有意义。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　汽车驶进了市区，里维埃让司机把他送到公司的办公室。鲁比诺自己则与贝勒兰留在车上。他看着他的背影，张嘴欲言又止。</p>
<p class="p1">　　五</p>
<p class="p1">　　可是，今晚鲁比诺感到懒洋洋的。面对胜利归来的贝勒兰，他发觉自己的生活灰溜溜的。尤其是他刚刚发现他鲁比诺虽然贵为督察员，有权有势，却不如这个困顿难当、两手沾满油污、闭着眼睛歪倒在汽车角落里的人。鲁比诺第一次产生钦佩之情。他想把这种心情说出来，他特别需要得到友谊。旅途的奔波，时间的挫折，使他提不起精神。也许他还感到自己有点儿可笑。今晚他在盘点汽油时，把账目算得一塌糊涂，后来还是那位他老想找岔子的职员看不过眼，帮他算好了。但是最讨厌的是，他批评<span class="s1">B6</span>型油泵没有安装好，却把<span class="s1">B4</span>型的和<span class="s1">B6</span>型油泵混淆了。那些滑头的机械师听任他揶揄<span class="s1">"</span>这种不可饶恕的无知<span class="s1">"</span>达二十分钟之久，其实他揶揄的恰好是自己的无知。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他也害怕在旅馆里租用的那个房间。每次从图鲁兹飞到布宜诺斯艾利斯，下班后，他总是回到这个房间，把自己关在里面，心事重重地从手提箱里抽出一沓纸，慢吞吞地写着<span class="s1">"</span>报告<span class="s1">"</span>。他胡乱写上几行，然后又全部撕掉。他巴望着公司从危难中走出来，只是公司并没有任何险情。直到现在，他只救出了一只生锈的螺旋桨毂。他当着一位机场场长的面用手指在锈斑上来回摩擦，脸色忧郁，动作缓慢。看着这一幕，机场场长却回答说：<span class="s1">"</span>这锈斑的事，您去问前一站吧，飞机刚从那儿飞过来。<span class="s1">"</span>鲁比诺不由得怀疑起自己的角色。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他想跟贝勒兰套近乎，试探着问了一句：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>您愿意和我一起吃晚饭吗？我想说说话，我的职业有时不能讲情面。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他不愿一下就把身份降下来。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我肩负的责任重大啊！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　鲁比诺的下属都不喜欢他插足他们的私生活。每个人都在想：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>要是他还找不到材料凑他的报告，他就会饥不择食，对我下手。<span class="s1">"</span>可是鲁比诺今晚一心只想到自己的难处：身上长了讨厌的湿疹，真见不得人。他很想说出这种病来，博得别人的同情。他既然无法在傲慢中找到慰藉，便在谦卑中寻求。他在法国也有一个相好，每次出发回来的夜里，便向她吹嘘稽查别人的事，炫耀一番，博取她的爱情。但是这样做恰恰引起她的反感。他觉得有必要跟别人说说他的这个相好的事。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>说好了，你跟我一起吃晚饭吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　厚道的贝勒兰爽快地答应了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　六</p>
<p class="p1">　　在布宜诺斯艾利斯的办公室里，秘书们正在打瞌睡。这时，里维埃走了进来。他没有脱下大衣，依然戴着帽子，总是像一个常年在外奔波的旅人。他走过的时候，几乎无人察觉，因为他身材矮小，走过去的时候也悄无声息；因为他的花白头发和没有个性的衣着已经和周围的环境浑然一体了。然而，他有一股热情，把人都调动起来。于是，秘书们来了精神，办公室主任忙着最后几份文件，打字机嗒嗒地响。</p>
<p class="p1">　　电话接线员把插头插进交换机，并且将来往电报登记在一个厚厚的本子上。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃坐下来开始阅读。</p>
<p class="p1">　　读过在智利发生的那场灾难的报道之后，他又重读了平安的一天记事。这一天诸事井井有条，飞机飞经的机场一个接一个传来的尽是朴实无华的捷报。巴塔戈尼亚的邮政飞机速度也很快，可以提前到达，因为风顺着大气流从南向北吹着。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>把气象报告递给我吧。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　每个机场都自夸天气晴朗，碧天如洗，和风宜人。夜晚的美洲披上了一身金色的外衣。里维埃看到热气腾腾的场面感到高兴。眼下那架邮政航机正在高空上飞行，与黑夜的阴霾搏斗，不过运气极佳。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃推开本子。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>行！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他走到外间，看了一眼各科室的工作人员，他们都是照管着半个世界的守夜人。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他在一扇敞开的窗户跟前停下来。他懂得黑夜的含义了。黑夜裹着布宜诺斯艾利斯，也像宽阔的大殿笼罩着美洲。对于这种气势宏大的感觉，他并不惊讶，因为智利圣地亚哥的天空是异国的天空，可是，一旦飞机朝圣地亚哥飞去，在整个航程中，就像是生活在深邃的苍穹下。这时，地面上的工作人员还在戴着耳机监听飞机的声音，巴塔戈尼亚的渔民已经看到上面的灯光在闪烁。听到发动机轰隆的马达声，对飞行中的飞机的担忧压迫着里维埃，也压迫着各国的首都和省区的人们。</p>
<p class="p1">　　对着如此晴朗的夜空，他感到快慰。他想起雷雨交加的夜晚，飞机险象环生，仿佛要掉下去，无法救助。布宜诺斯艾利斯的无线电台传来低吟声，还夹杂着风雨的呼啸声。在这沉闷的嘈杂声中，音乐般的金色电波被淹没了。一架邮政班机像一支不长眼的箭冲向黑夜的壁垒，它所吟唱的小调是多么的凄凉啊！</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃认为，作为一名督察员，在值班的夜里，应该呆在办公室。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>派人去把鲁比诺给我找来。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　鲁比诺正要跟一位飞行员交上朋友。他在旅馆里当着飞行员的面打开手提箱，从箱子里拿出一些小玩意儿，有几件俗气的衬衫、一套梳妆用品、一幅瘦女人的照片。他就凭这些小东西与别人套近乎。他把女人照片钉在墙上，不太好意思地向贝勒兰供认自己的需要、情感和遗憾。他把那些宝贝玩意儿排成一行，排在一起反而更寒酸。他这样做是要把自己的痛处袒露出来。他害的是心灵上的湿疹。他在展示自己的牢笼。</p>
<p class="p1">　　然而，对于鲁比诺，正如对每一个人，仍然存在一线光明。他从箱子底取出一只珍藏的小包，心里感到十分甜蜜。他用手指拍打小包，拍了很久，却一句话也不说，后来才松开手。<span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>"</span>这是我从撒哈拉带回来的<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　督察员竟然大胆将自己的私情和盘托出，不禁脸红起来。他的烦恼多多，家庭的事也不顺，现实又一片灰暗。不过，这些黑色的小石头为他打开了通往神秘世界的大门，这使他感到宽慰。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他的脸红得更厉害了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>这样的石头在巴西也有<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　这位督察员正埋头看着亚特兰蒂斯（译注：是一个虚构词，指欧美两大洲，据说从前两大洲是相连的）的地图，贝勒兰拍了拍他的肩膀。</p>
<p class="p1">　　贝勒兰不好意思地问道：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>您喜欢地质学？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我是个地质迷。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　生活中，唯有石头令他还有点温情。</p>
<p class="p1">　　有人在叫鲁比诺，他露出了愁容，但马上变得不苟言笑。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我得走了，里维埃先生要我去商量几项重大的决策。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　鲁比诺走进办公室的时候，里维埃已经把他给忘了。他正站在一张挂在墙上的地图前沉思，地图上用红线标出公司的飞行网络，督察员则在一旁等他下命令。过了好长时间，里维埃连头也不回就问他：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>鲁比诺，您觉得这张地图怎么样？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他往往在胡思乱想之后提出一些莫名其妙的问题。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>长官先生，这张地图<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　说实话，督察员对这张地图并没有什么看法，但仍然一脸严肃地盯着，审视着欧洲和美洲地图。里维埃仍然陷在沉思中，想什么却没有告诉他。<span class="s1">"</span>这个飞行网络在美丽的外表下隐藏着凶险，它夺去了不少人的生命，不少青年人的生命。它横陈于此，铁板钉钉，不容变更，可是它却给我们带来多少问题！<span class="s1">"</span>说虽是这么说，里维埃还是把要达到的目标放在高于一切的位置上。鲁比诺站在他身旁，眼睛仍然直视面前的这幅地图，慢慢挺直身子。他不指望从里维埃那儿得到丝毫的怜悯。</p>
<p class="p1">　　有一次他曾经想碰碰运气，向他诉说自己染了见不得人的小疾，生活很不如意。但是里维埃竟以一句俏皮话回答他：<span class="s1">"</span>如果这玩意儿让您睡不踏实，那它倒会让您活动起来。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　其实这也不尽是开玩笑的话。里维埃喜欢说这样一句话：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>如果失眠能使音乐家创作出美妙的作品，那么能失眠就太好了。<span class="s1">"</span>一天，他指着勒鲁对他说：<span class="s1">"</span>您瞧这张吓跑爱情的丑脸多美啊<span class="s1">……"</span>勒鲁身上的一切优秀品质，也许归功于他这副模样，正是这样他才专注于工作而没有二心。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>您跟贝勒兰很有交情吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">　　</span>"<span class="s2">唔！</span>……"</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我不是在怪您。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃认为，每天晚上在空中发生一些意想不到的事，如果意志不够坚强就会导致失败。从现在到天亮也许还有一番搏斗呢。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>您应该继续演好自己的角色。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃字斟句酌地说：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>明晚您或许就要派遣这位飞行员执行一项危险的任务，他得服从。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">　　</span>"<span class="s2">是啊</span>……"</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>您几乎掌握着人的生命，掌握着比您价值更高的人的生命<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他看来像犹豫了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>这个，问题可严重了。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃一直迈着小步走，沉默了一下子。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>如果他们出于交情服从您的命令，那您是在欺骗他们。您没有权利要他们作出任何牺牲。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>没有<span class="s1">……</span>当然没有。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>还有，如果他们以为跟您有了交情，就可以免却某些苦差事，那您也是在欺骗他们，因为他们还得老实服从命令。请到那儿坐下来说吧。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃用手轻轻地把鲁比诺推到他的办公室。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>鲁比诺，我要把您请上自己的位置。如果您烦了，那不该由这些人支撑您。您是上司。您的软弱招人笑话。写吧。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">　　</span>"<span class="s2">我</span>……"</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>您这样写：<span class="s1">'</span>督察员鲁比诺出于某种原因，给予飞行员贝勒兰某种处罚<span class="s1">……'</span>您会找到个什么理由的。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>长官先生！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>鲁比诺，您就当明白我的意思去写吧！爱您对之发号施令的人，但不要对他们明说。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　听到这些话，鲁比诺准会又精神十足地指挥人擦拭螺旋桨毂的。</p>
<p class="p1">　　一个备降机场发来电报称：<span class="s1">"</span>飞机正出现，并发出<span class="s1">'</span>降低转速准备着陆<span class="s1">'</span>的信号。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　我们或许又要耽误半个小时了。当一列特别快车停在车道上，时间一分钟一分钟地过去，却仍然停着而不跨越辽阔的原野时，人们的心情是十分焦急的。里维埃感受到了这种心情。时钟的大针现在正勾勒出死一般沉寂的空间。在这个圆规般的跨度里，该有多少事可以容纳其间。里维埃走出室外，要排遣那种等待的焦急心情。在他眼里，黑夜一片空幽，仿佛没有演员的剧院。<span class="s1">"</span>这样的夜晚就要消逝！<span class="s1">"</span>他怀着怨气，透过窗户，遥看繁星满天的朗朗夜空，凝视这排神奇的航标灯，还有那一轮皓月，感叹金子般的夜晚被亵渎了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　但是，飞机一起飞，夜晚对里维埃来说，就变得美丽动人了。这夜晚孕育着生命，里维埃对它倍加爱护。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>你们会遇上什么天气呢？<span class="s1">"</span>他让人询问机组。</p>
<p class="p1">　　十分钟过去了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>十分晴朗。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　接着传来了几个法国城市的名字。在里维埃看来，这无异于这次战斗中攻陷的城市。</p>
<p class="p1">　　七</p>
<p class="p1">　　一个小时后，巴塔戈尼亚的邮政班机的报务员感觉像是有个肩膀将他轻轻地托起。他环顾四周，只见密云遮住了星星。他俯瞰地面，寻找村落的点点灯火。这些灯火像躲在草丛中的萤火虫，可是，这会儿黑糊糊的草地上却没有一点亮光。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他心情郁闷，预感这一夜将不会好过，既要前进，又要后退，占领的地盘还要拱手相让。他不懂飞行员的策略，他依稀觉得，夜越深，飞得越远，越像撞到一堵墙上。</p>
<p class="p1">　　这时候，他发现正前方的地平线上有一道若隐若现的亮光，仿佛是打铁炉的火光。报务员用手碰了一下法比安的肩膀，可是法比安却一动不动。</p>
<p class="p1">　　远方头一轮涡流向飞机袭来。这个金属的庞然大物被缓缓地托起，把报务员的身体碰了一下。飞机似乎消失了，被融化掉了。在好几秒钟里，报务员竟孤身在黑夜中飞荡。于是，他只好用双手紧紧抓住钢翼梁。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他什么也看不到，只看见座舱里的红灯。他仿佛坠入漆黑一片的夜里，孤独无援，只有一盏小矿灯护着。他禁不住打了个寒颤。他想了解飞行员决定怎么办，但又不敢惊动他，只好用手紧抓住钢翼梁，身体朝他前倾，看着他那暗淡的颈背。</p>
<p class="p1">　　微弱的亮光中，只见一颗脑袋和一副一动不动的肩膀，整个身子成了一团阴影，稍稍歪向左边，脸庞迎着暴风雨，被一阵阵的闪电照亮。但是报务员并没有看到他的脸。这张脸流露着迎击暴风雨的各种表情：紧抿嘴巴，意志坚定，怒火中烧。这一切在那张苍白的脸孔和外面闪烁的电光之间交流着的最本质的东西，对于报务员来说，都是不可窥透的。</p>
<p class="p1">　　然而，他能猜透汇集在这个一动不动的身影上的那股力量，他喜爱这股力量。这股力量兴许会带着他冲向暴风雨，但同时又是他的保护伞。那紧紧握着操纵杆的双手，也许已压迫着暴风雨，仿佛压在一头野兽的颈背上，而那副强有力的肩膀岿然不动，让人感觉到其中蕴藏着深沉的力量。</p>
<p class="p1">　　报务员认为，一切有飞行员担着。现在，他仿佛坐在骑士的身后，风驰电掣地朝着一场大火冲击。于是，他细细地品味着眼前的这个黑影所表现出的质与力，以及坚忍不拔的精神。</p>
<p class="p1">　　左边，又亮起了一点火光，微弱得像一闪一闪的灯塔。</p>
<p class="p1">　　报务员动了一下身子，碰碰法比安的肩膀，告诉他有一点火光，但是，他看见法比安慢慢地回过头来，凝视着这个新的敌人好一会儿，然后，才慢慢恢复原来的姿势，而那副肩膀仍然一动不动，那脖子靠在皮椅靠背上。</p>
<p class="p1">　　八</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃走到室外，烦闷又袭上心头。他要走一走，排解心中的不快。他这个人活着就是要干一番事业，让这事业充满戏剧情节。但是，奇怪的是，他却感到这出戏正在移位，变成了他个人的戏了。他想，小城镇里的小市民围绕这音乐厅，过着一种貌似平静的生活，可是有时却因疾病、爱情、死亡这些剧情以及可能是别的什么剧情而显出沉重。他自身的遭遇教会了他许多东西：<span class="s1">"</span>这样就等于打开了一扇窗口。<span class="s1">"</span>他想。</p>
<p class="p1">　　夜里将近十一点，他感觉呼吸舒畅了些，便朝办公室方向走去。电影院门口挤满了人，他用肩膀慢慢分开人群。他举目眺望星空，星星在这段狭窄的道路上发着光，但是在耀眼的广告彩灯面前黯然失色。他想：<span class="s1">"</span>今晚，我有两架邮政飞机在空中飞行，我就得对整个空中的情况负责。这颗星星就是个信号，它在这群人中寻找我，并且找到了我，所以我觉得有点儿怪怪的，有点儿孤独。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他回想起一段乐曲，是昨天他与几位朋友一起听过的奏鸣曲中的音符。他的朋友听不懂，说：<span class="s1">"</span>那艺术烦我们，也烦您，只是您不承认罢了。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>也许吧<span class="s1">……"</span>他回答道。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他当时也像今天一样感到孤独，但很快就发现这样的孤独有丰富的内涵。乐曲饱含着意蕴，带着一桩秘密特有的柔情，进入他的心中，仅仅进入置身于一群平庸之辈里的他的心中。星星也蕴涵这种信物，它越过这许许多多的肩膀，用一种只有他才能听得懂的语言对他说话。</p>
<p class="p1">　　人行道上，他被推搡着。他还在想：<span class="s1">"</span>我不会生气的。我就像一个病孩的父亲，碎步在人群中走着，心中惦念着自己悄无声息的家。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他抬头看着行人，努力在他们当中辨认出那些一边迈着小步，一边想着创意和爱情的人。他还想到灯塔的看守是多么孤苦伶仃。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他喜欢办公楼里的安静。他慢慢地逐个穿过一间间的办公室，脚步发出轻轻的响声。打字机在罩子下睡大觉。整齐的卷宗锁在大柜子里。十年的劳动，十年的经验啊！他猛然想到自己是在参观一家银行的金库，里面堆着沉甸甸的财宝。他想，每一本账本上所积累的比金子更贵重，那是维系生命的力量，是一种活生生但又像银行里的金子一样沉睡的力量。</p>
<p class="p1">　　在某个地方，他也许会遇见唯一的值班秘书。他一个人正在某个地方工作，以保证生活继续、信念依然，这样，一个站接另一个站，从图鲁兹到布宜诺斯艾利斯的长链才不会中断。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>这个人不知道自己有多伟大。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　邮政飞机正在某个地方搏斗着。夜航好比生小孩，需要有人陪夜。要全力帮助这些夜航的人，他们手足并用，胸膛贴着胸膛，与黑夜搏斗。他们除了一些无形的、活动的东西之外，再也认不清别的东西，什么也认不清了。他们必须用不长眼睛的双臂的力量，从中脱身，就像从汪洋大海中游出来。有时候，有些描述夜航情形的话听起来就像在摄影师的暗室里，这双毛茸茸的手孤零零地呈现在红灯下。这双手是黑茫茫的宇宙所仅有的，也是必须拯救的。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃推开营运室的门，里面只有一盏灯，把角落里照得一片亮堂。唯一的一台打字机发出的嗒嗒声，没有打破寂静，而是给它赋予了一层意义。电话铃声凄切地响着。值班秘书摘下听筒，在阴暗的角落里压低声音说话，无形的忧虑缓和了。接着，外表沉着的他回到办公桌前，因为孤独和困顿，脸上的神情捉摸不透，心里的秘密更让人猜不着。当两架邮政班机还在空中飞行的时候，夜间从别处打来的电话包含着什么样的威胁呢？里维埃想到那些夜间在灯下读着让飞行员家属伤心的电报，然后又想到那在永恒的几秒钟之内令父亲的神情变化莫测的灾难。声波先是很微弱，与叫喊声很不相同，又那么安静。然而，他每一次都听得到羞答答的铃声中自己微弱的回声。每一次，值班秘书因为孤独，动作缓慢得像钻入深水中的泳者从暗处向灯光游来，也像潜水员浮出水面。在里维埃看来，他的动作蕴藏着一个个的秘密。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>别动，我去接。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃拿起听筒，听到了整个世界的喧嚣声。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我是里维埃。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　先是一阵嘈杂声，然后传来了说话声：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我给您接报务员。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　又是一阵杂音，是插头插入电话交换机的声音，然后又是另一个人的声音：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我是报务员，有几份电报的内容要向您转达。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃做着记录，点点头：</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">　　</span>"<span class="s2">好的</span>……<span class="s2">好的</span>……"</p>
<p class="p1">　　没有什么大事，都是例行的公文。里约热内卢方面打听一件事。蒙特维迪亚说了天气情况，而门得萨则谈了器材问题，尽是些熟悉的家常事。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>邮政班机情况如何？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>有暴风雨，我们没有听到飞机的声音。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>好。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃想，这儿的夜色朗朗，星光灿烂，而报务员能在这黑夜里察觉到远方暴风雨的气息。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>回头再联系。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃站起来，秘书走近他：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>这是几份公文，请签字，先生。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃发现自己对这位秘书怀有深厚的情谊，他也肩负着黑夜的压力。<span class="s1">"</span>这是一位战友，<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃想，<span class="s1">"</span>他也许永远不知道，这次值夜让我们多么团结。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　九</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃手里拿着一沓文件，回到自己的个人办公室。这时，他感到右肋一阵剧痛。这几周，剧痛一直折磨着他。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>不行了<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他靠墙站了一会儿。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>真是莫名其妙。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　然后他走到扶手椅子坐下。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他又一次感到自己像一头被捆住手脚的衰老狮子，心头涌上一阵巨大的忧伤。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>真是积劳成疾了！我五十岁了，五十年来，生活总是过得很充实，读书、奋斗，曾经改变过某些事情的进程，现在好了，整天忙忙碌碌，工作绷得紧之又紧，把世上的事看得比什么都重要<span class="s1">……</span>这真荒唐。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他等了等，用手揩了汗。剧痛过去了之后，他又开始工作。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他慢慢地审阅文件。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我们在布宜诺斯艾利斯拆除<span class="s1">301</span>型发动机时发现<span class="s1">……</span>拟给以该负责人严厉处分。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他签上字。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>弗罗里亚诺波里斯中途站没有遵照指示<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他签上字。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>为严肃纪律，拟将<span class="s1">……</span>的里查德机场场长调走。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他签上字。</p>
<p class="p1">　　接下来，虽然疼痛有所缓解，但仍未止住，并且像是生命增添了新的内容一样有一种异样的感觉，这使他不得不考虑自己的事。他不禁感到些许酸楚。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我究竟公正还是不公正呢？我不知道。如果我经常敲打他们，故障就减少。那些负有责任的人不是人，而是一股无形的力量。如果不触动每一个人，就永远也无法触动这股力量。我若事事讲公正，那么夜间飞行一次就会给死神提供一次可乘之机。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　这条路走得如此艰难，使他感到有些疲倦。他想怜悯是件好事。他翻着文件，浮想联翩。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"……</span>罗布雷从今天开始不再是本公司员工。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他想起了这位老兄，想起傍晚的对话：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>杀一儆百，没有办法啊，杀一儆百。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>可是先生<span class="s1">……</span>可是先生。一次，就这一次，请您再考虑考虑！我干了一辈子呀！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>得杀一儆百。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>可是先生！<span class="s1">……</span>您瞧，先生！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　于是，他拿起这只旧皮包，还有这张旧报纸，上面有一张罗布雷年轻的时候站在飞机旁照的照片。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃看到，那双捧着这份淳朴荣誉的衰老的手在颤抖。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>先生，这是<span class="s1">1910</span>年照的<span class="s1">……</span>阿根廷的第一架飞机可是我装配的啊！从<span class="s1">1910</span>年起<span class="s1">……</span>先生，我就进入航空界，二十年了！可是，您怎么能够说<span class="s1">……</span>那些青年人<span class="s1">……</span>先生，他们会在机修厂里耻笑我的！<span class="s1">……</span>唉，他们会狠狠地耻笑我的！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>这个嘛，我就管不着了。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>那我的孩子该怎么办呀，先生，我还有孩子呢！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我跟您说过，我会给您安排做工人的。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>那我的脸往哪里放啊，先生，我的脸！您瞧，我在航空界干了二十年，像我这样的老资格熟练工人<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>就是做个普通工。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我不干，先生，我不干！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　那双衰老的手在发抖。里维埃将视线从这发皱而粗糙但却长得不难看的手上移开。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>就去当工人。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>不，先生，不<span class="s1">……</span>我还有话要对你说<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>您可以走了。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃心想：<span class="s1">"</span>我这样粗暴地打发走的并不是他，这次差错也许不是他的责任，但却是通过他发生的。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>因为凡事必须有人指挥，<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃想，<span class="s1">"</span>事情才能按人的意愿发展，人才能创造。人是可怜之物，也需要对他们进行创造。当祸害通过他们的手发生时，那就要将他们弃之不用。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我还有话要对您说<span class="s1">……"</span>这位可怜的老兄还想说什么呢？说人家掠走了他往日的乐趣？说他喜欢听到工具敲打飞机钢铁零件上的丁当声？说人家剥夺了他生活中的诗意？还说<span class="s1">……</span>他要活下去？</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我已经精疲力竭了。<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃想。他的体温在升高，给他一种被抚摩的感觉。他拍打着文件，心想：<span class="s1">"</span>我本来很喜欢这位老伙计的脸<span class="s1">……"</span>然后，里维埃又看了看他那双手，想象这双手合拢时的动作。他只要说声<span class="s1">"</span>行了，行了，留下吧<span class="s1">"</span>，问题就解决了。里维埃想象得出，他那喜悦之情就会像泉水一样在这双衰老的手流淌。在他看来，那份不是用这张脸，而是用这双工人衰老的手将要表露的喜悦之情，是世界上最美好的情感。<span class="s1">"</span>我把这文件撕掉了？<span class="s1">"</span>果真是这样，那么，老工人一家在他晚上回去的时候，该是多少有点儿得意了。他们会问道：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>呃，他们把你留下吧？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>是这样的，还用问吗？阿根廷的第一架飞机是我装配的嘛！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　就这样，青年工人不再笑话他，老前辈的声誉也挽回了<span class="s1">……</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我撕了？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　这时，电话铃响了，里维埃拿起话筒。</p>
<p class="p1">　　电话里很长时间没有人说话，接着是风、空间融进人的声音时的回响和深邃感。终于有人说话了：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我是机场。您是哪位？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>经理先生，<span class="s1">605</span>号航班已经降落在跑道上。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>好的。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>一切准备就绪，但是，越是在最后的时刻，越应该认真检查电路。线路连接坏了。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>好。是谁安装电路的？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我们去核实一下。如果您同意，我们就进行处罚。飞机的灯光出故障，这事非同小可。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>那当然。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃想：<span class="s1">"</span>出了差错，不论出在哪里，如果不及时清除，就会引起灯光故障。万一差错危害仪器，放过它简直是犯罪。所以，罗布雷还得走人。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　秘书什么也没有看见，照样在打字。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>这是什么？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>半月报表。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>为什么还没有做好？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">　　</span>"<span class="s2">我</span>……"</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>走着瞧吧。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>奇怪，事故老占上风，像一股无形的巨大力量，可以把原始森林连根拔起，不断地扩张，咄咄逼人，对一项项伟大的事业出击。<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃不由得想起那些被小小的爬藤攀满而坍塌的庙宇。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>一项伟大的事业<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　为了使自己放下心来，他还在想：<span class="s1">"</span>所有这些人，我都喜欢他们。我要反的并不是这些人本身，而是由他们引出的事故<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他的心跳得很快，让他难受。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我不知道自己所做的好不好。我不知道人生的确切价值，也不懂得正义和痛苦如何衡量。至于欢乐的意义何在，我也不甚了了。我不理解一只手颤抖意味着什么，也不懂得怜悯和温情<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他陷入深深的思索：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>生活处处充满矛盾。人在生活中要努力解决矛盾<span class="s1">……</span>这样生命才能延续下去，才能得以创造，才能去腐存新<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃仍然在沉思，这时电话铃响了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>给欧洲航班的飞行员打电话，让他在出发前来我这儿。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他想：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>可不能让这架飞机中途返航。我要是不敲打手下人，黑夜便会令他们心里不踏实。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　十</p>
<p class="p1">　　飞行员的妻子被电话铃声吵醒，朝丈夫看了一眼，心想：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>让他再睡一会儿。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　她欣赏他那流线型的裸露的胸膛，这使她联想到一艘漂亮的船。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他在这张宁静的床上歇息，就像船停泊在港湾似的。为了不打扰他的睡眠，她用手指抚平那道褶皱，抹去那片阴影和波浪。她铺平这张床，就像神奇的手指一挥，大海就变得风平浪静一样。</p>
<p class="p1">　　她起床打开窗户，一阵风扑面吹来。卧室可以俯视布宜诺斯艾利斯。邻居的屋子里，人们正在跳舞，悠扬的乐曲随风飘来。此时正是娱乐和休闲的时间。整座城市把人们都关在千万座堡垒里，一切都是那么静谧而安宁。但是，对这个女人来说，好像是有人就要呼叫：<span class="s1">"</span>拿起武器！<span class="s1">"</span>然而，挺身而出的只有一个人，那就是她的丈夫。他还在歇息，但是，他的歇息很可怕，那是预备队投入战斗前的歇息。这座沉睡的城市保护不了他。当年轻的战神起床、升天并绝尘而去的时候，城市的灯海如同虚设。她看着他这双结实的胳膊，一小时之后将扛起欧洲航班的命运，担负起重大的使命，仿佛城市的命运就掌握在他手中。想到这里，她感到有些慌乱。在这几百万人当中，唯有他一人准备去挑战这种离奇的牺牲。她心里感到不是滋味。她虽然温柔体贴，也无法把他留住。她侍候他，照顾他，爱抚他，不是为了她自己，而是为了与他度过这个夜晚，或者是为了那些她毫不知情的搏斗、焦虑和胜利。然而，这个夜晚却要把他夺走。她的一双柔软的手只是一双驯服的手，干了什么真正的活儿自己并不知道。她熟悉丈夫的笑容、情人般的体贴，但是不了解他在狂风暴雨中神圣不可犯的震怒。她用音乐、爱情、鲜花这些甜蜜的锁链套住他，可是，每次出发，这些锁链就颓然落地，而他并没有显出难过的样子。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他睁开眼睛。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>几点了？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>半夜十二点。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>天气怎么样？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>不知道<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他从床上爬起来，一边伸懒腰，一边慢慢向窗户走去。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我不会太冷的。风向如何？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>你叫我怎么知道<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他探了探身子，说：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>南风，太好了。至少到巴西以前不会改变风向。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他发现月亮挂在天空中，感到很幸运。然后，他低下头俯瞰城市。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他觉得这座城市并不亲切，也不温暖，而且暗淡无光。他看到，沙子般的灯光若隐若现，正在褪去。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>你在想什么？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他在想阿雷格里港可能出现的薄雾。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我有办法对付，我知道打哪儿绕过去。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他一直弯着腰。他深深地吸了一口气，仿佛赤身裸体要往海里跳。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>你一点儿都不难过。<span class="s1">……</span>你这一走要去多少天呀？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　十天八天，他不知道。说难过吗？不。为什么难过？那一片片的原野、一个个的城市、一座座山峰<span class="s1">……</span>他就要无拘无束地去征服它们。他也想到，不出一个小时，他就要飞临布宜诺斯艾利斯，然后又离它而去。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他笑了，说道：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>这座城市啊<span class="s1">……</span>我很快就要离它远去。夜间飞行太棒了。一拉油门，脸朝南方，十秒钟之后，整个田野山川翻了个个儿，脸就朝北了，这座城市也变成了海底。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他想到了征服山河所抛在身后的一切。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>你不爱自己的家吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我当然爱<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　但是他的妻子却感到他已踏上征程，宽阔的肩膀扛着天空。</p>
<p class="p1">　　她手指着天空让他看。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>你遇上了好天气，路上铺满了星星。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他笑了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>是的。<span class="s1">"</span>他说。</p>
<p class="p1">　　她把手搭在这副肩膀上，感到暖融融的，不由得动了情。这身子会受到威胁吗？</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>你身体很壮，但是要小心谨慎啊！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>小心谨慎，那当然<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他还在笑。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他穿上衣服。为了这次过节一般的夜航，他选择穿上粗糙的布衣和笨重的皮鞋，整个儿一身农民打扮。他穿得越笨重，她愈发欣赏他。她亲自给他扣腰带，穿靴子。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>这双靴子穿起来有点儿不舒服。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>给你另一双。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>找根绳子给我，系好应急灯。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　她望着他，亲手把这身铠甲的最后一丝不顺眼的地方调整好，直至一切都舒舒服服。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>你真俊。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　她看见他正在精心梳头。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>梳给星星看吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我真嫉妒<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他正在笑，并且拥抱了她，把她搂在自己笨重的衣服里，然后张开双臂把她抱起来，像举起一个小姑娘一样，始终笑哈哈的，把她放到床上，说：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>睡吧！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他关上门，走到街上，来到辨认不清的夜行人中，迈出走向征服山河的第一步。</p>
<p class="p1">　　她呆在家里，黯然神伤，看看这些花朵、这些书籍、这份温情。这一切对于她来说，只不过是一片海底而已。</p>
<p class="p1">　　十一</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃正在接待他。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>您在上一回的航班中跟我开了个玩笑。当时气象情况好好的，您却中途返航，其实您是可以飞过去的。你是不是害怕了？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　飞行员没料到这一着，一声不吭。他慢慢地搓着两只手，然后抬起头来，直面里维埃，说道：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>是这样的。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃动了恻隐之心，这么个勇敢的小伙子居然也害怕起来。飞行员想申辩。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>当时我什么也看不见。当然，稍远一点儿<span class="s1">……</span>也许<span class="s1">……</span>报务员说<span class="s1">……</span>可是驾驶室里的灯太暗了，我连自己的手也看不见。我想打开航行灯，好看见机翼，但我找不到。我感到像是掉进一个深深的洞底，想爬也爬不上来。那时，发动机又开始发颤。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>不会吧。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>不会？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>不会的。我们后来检查过，发动机正常得很。不过，一个人害怕的时候，总以为发动机在颤动。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>当时谁不害怕啊！群山迎面而来，我想上升，却遇到强大的气流。您知道，遇到气流<span class="s1">……</span>眼前什么也看不见时<span class="s1">……</span>我不仅没法拉起飞机，反而还下降了一百米。我甚至连陀螺仪、气压计也看不见了。我似乎感到，发动机的转速已经减慢，机身发烫，油压也降低了<span class="s1">……</span>这一切全发生在黑暗中，简直就像得了病似的。当我返航重新看到灯火辉煌的城市时，心里真高兴。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>您的想像力真丰富。行了。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　于是飞行员走了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃坐进了扶手椅里，用手撩了一下灰白的头发。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>这是我手下最勇敢的飞行员。那天晚上他成功返航真了不起，但是我得把他从恐惧中拯救出来<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　接着，他的心像是又软下来一样：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>要想让别人喜欢自己，只需表达同情就行。我根本不会表达同情，或者说我把同情隐藏起来了<span class="s1">……</span>然而我可是喜欢生活在友谊和温情中的。医生由于职业的关系，常常遇到友谊和温情。但是，我的服务对象是事。我必须把我的部下打造好，让他们把事情做好。夜晚，每当我坐在办公室里，面对一张张航程表，我深深体会到这条潜规则的分量。如果我放任自流，工作安排好了就不闻不问，那么，那些稀奇古怪的事就会发生。这样做真好像只要有了我的意旨就能避免飞机出事，或者阻止风暴耽搁邮政飞机的飞行。有时我对自己拥有的权力之大感到惊讶。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他还在思索：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>也许这是很清楚的了。园丁在草坪上日复一日的工作就是如此。他以一手之力，将大地始终在培育的原始森林推回到泥土中去。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他想到那位飞行员：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我把他从恐惧中拯救出来。我并不是要跟他过不去，我要打击的只是在他身上滋生的阻力，这种阻力让下属在陌生事物面前懈怠。要是我信他的话，同情他，把他的险遇当真，他便会以为自己从一个神秘之地凯旋，而大家怕的正是这种神秘。应该让手下人下到这口漆黑的井里，然后爬上来，说自己什么也没有见到。这个人必须下到黑夜的深处，黑咕隆咚的深夜，连那盏只能照亮双手和机翼的矿灯也不带，而用宽阔的肩膀推开未知之物。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　然而，在这场搏斗中，有一种默默的兄弟情谊将他们<span class="s1">--</span>里维埃和飞行员的心连在一起。他们风雨同舟，怀有克敌制胜的决心。但是，里维埃却想到了另外几次他为了战胜黑夜而进行的战斗。</p>
<p class="p1">　　官方人士个个都害怕这片阴森森的境地，那仿佛是一块未经开垦的热带丛林。让一个机组以每小时两百公里的速度冲向隐藏在夜幕下的风雨和迷雾，冲破重重的物质障碍，这种冒险，在他们看来，如果是执行战斗任务的飞机，还是情有可原的：在月色清朗的夜晚，飞离机场去投弹轰炸，然后回到原地。但是，定期航班夜间飞行容易出事。<span class="s1">"</span>对我们航空公司来说，<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃曾经反驳过，<span class="s1">"</span>这是一个生死攸关的问题，因为我们白天对铁路和水运所取得的优势，到了晚上就会丧失殆尽。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃听人谈论报表、保险，特别是公共舆论，感到很厌烦。<span class="s1">"</span>公共舆论<span class="s1">……"</span>他针锋相对地说，<span class="s1">"</span>还不是由人操纵的！<span class="s1">"</span>他想：<span class="s1">"</span>这可浪费多少时间啊！有些事<span class="s1">……</span>比这一切更重要。有生命的东西，为了生存，不惜推倒一切；为了生存，创造了自己特有的规律。这是不可抗拒的。<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃不知道商用飞机何时开辟夜航，但这是大势所趋，必须有所准备。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他回想起那一张张的绿色的会议桌。他曾经坐在这些会议桌前，用拳头托着下巴，听到各种各样的反对意见，心里有一种不可名状的感觉。在他看来，这些意见，很有分量：<span class="s1">"</span>我的理由充分有力，我会胜利的。<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃心想，<span class="s1">"</span>这是势在必然。<span class="s1">"</span>当大家要他拿出解决问题避免一切风险的可行办法时，他回答说：<span class="s1">"</span>经验出规律。对规律的认识绝不会先于经验。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　经过长达一年的斗争，里维埃赢得了胜利。一些人说：<span class="s1">"</span>他的胜利靠的是信念。<span class="s1">"</span>另一些人则说：<span class="s1">"</span>那是由于他坚忍不拔、一往无前的精神。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　但是，开创时期需要多么谨慎啊！飞机在天亮前一小时起飞，日落后一小时就着陆。当里维埃对自己的经验充满信心的时候，他才敢把邮政飞机投入深沉的黑夜中。他几乎没有人追随，甚至得不到承认，所以现在仍然是单枪匹马地奋斗。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃按铃，要了解正在空中飞行的飞机的最新情况。</p>
<p class="p1">　　十二</p>
<p class="p1">　　然而就在这时，巴塔戈尼亚的邮政飞机遇上了雷雨。但是，法比安不打算绕道。他估计雷雨区域太大，因为闪电直插这个国家的内陆，映照出一座座堡垒状的乌云。他打算从乌云下面飞过，要是事情不妙，就决定返航。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他看了一下飞机的高度，是一千七百米。他把手掌压在操纵杆上，开始下降。发动机剧烈地震动起来，机身也随即抖动。法比安根据判断，调整了下降角度，然后查看地图上山丘的角度：五百米。为了留有余地，他拉高升至七百米。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他牺牲高度，就像一个人拿自己的财产来赌博一样。</p>
<p class="p1">　　飞机遇上一阵涡流，往下沉，抖动更厉害了。法比安感到天要悄悄塌下来似的威胁。他想返航，途中遇到千万颗星星。但是，他一度弯也拐不过来。</p>
<p class="p1">　　法比安计算着他的机会。或许这只是一场局部的雷雨，因为下一个中途站特雷利乌报告说四分之三的天空有云。这就意味着，他在这堆混凝土般的乌云中要飞差不多二十分钟。可是，飞行员法比安深感不安。他顶着一股劲风俯身向左，想把这漆黑的夜里的模糊光线看清楚。但是，这可不是什么光线，而是黑夜里乌云密度变化引起视觉疲劳眼花而已。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他打开报务员给他的纸条，上面写着：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我们现在在哪儿？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　要是能弄清楚这个问题，法比安花多大的代价都认了。他回答说：<span class="s1">"</span>不清楚，我们正在靠指南针穿越雷雨区。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他又俯下身子。他感到排气管喷出的火焰很碍事，这火焰就挂在发动机上，像一串火花，如此的惨白，要是有月光的话会看不见，但是，在这茫茫的虚无中，却吞没了整个有形世界。他瞧了一眼火焰，它被风吹得直往上蹿，仿佛火炬一样。</p>
<p class="p1">　　法比安每隔三十秒钟，就把头伸进座舱检查陀螺仪和罗盘。他再也不敢点亮那些微弱的红灯。这些红灯会把他的眼睛照得久久地发花。但是，所有带夜光的仪表都发出像星光一样淡的亮光。在座舱里，置身于一根根的指针和一个个数字之间，飞行员法比安有一种虚假的安全感，跟坐在惊涛骇浪中航行的船只的驾驶舱里一样。黑夜，连同它所裹挟的岩石、漂浮物、山丘，一齐撞向飞机，令人胆战心惊。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我们现在在哪儿？<span class="s1">"</span>报务员又重问了一遍。</p>
<p class="p1">　　法比安又抬起头，身子靠左，警惕地注视前方。他再也不知道要花多少时间、多少力气才能使自己摆脱黑暗的羁绊。他都不大相信还能脱身，因为他把自己的命运押在了这张又脏又皱的纸头上。为了使自己好好保存希望，他打开这张纸，读了千百遍：<span class="s1">"</span>特雷利乌天空四分之三有云，有微弱西风。<span class="s1">"</span>如果特雷利乌上空真的是四分之三有云，那就可以从云隙间窥见城市的亮光，起码<span class="s1">……</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　远处充满希望的一线淡淡的亮光促使他继续往前飞行。然而他将信将疑，便草草地给报务员写了几个字：<span class="s1">"</span>我不知道能否闯过去。请告知飞机后面天气是否仍然晴朗。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　回电使他感到沮丧：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>科摩多罗报告，无法返回，有暴风雨。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他开始猜测到，一场猛烈的暴风雨正从安第斯山脉直扑大海。在他飞越安第斯山脉之前，台风就会横扫沿线的城市。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>询问圣安东尼奥的天气情况。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>圣安东尼奥方面回答：西风起，伴有暴风雨，天空全部有云。圣安东尼奥方面因线路杂音接听不清楚。我亦听不清楚。因放电，我看要马上抽回天线。您往回飞吗？有何打算？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>别烦我。询问布兰卡港的天气<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>布兰卡港回答：预计二十分钟之内将有大雷雨袭击布兰卡港西部上空。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>询问特雷利乌的天气。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>特雷利乌回答：西部有飓风，速度每秒三十米，夹有大雨。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>通知布宜诺斯艾利斯：四面受困，一千公里路途上有暴风雨，我们什么也看不见。怎么办？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　对于法比安来说，这真是个无边的黑夜，它通不到港口，（所有的港口遥不可及）也迎不来黎明，因为再过一小时四十分，汽油就会耗尽。飞机迟早会不知不觉地在这深沉的黑夜中栽下去。</p>
<p class="p1">　　要是他能熬到天亮<span class="s1">……</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　法比安想到黎明，就像想到那经过艰难的漫漫长夜之后可以歇息歇息的金色沙滩，想到风雨飘摇的飞机下面要现出平原的边缘，宁静的大地怀抱着一座座沉睡的农庄，还有成群的牛羊和起伏的丘陵。黑暗中一切翻滚的漂浮物将不会伤人。如果可能，他真想朝着白昼游过去。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他想起自己已陷入重围。在这深沉的黑夜中，不管好歹，一切都会有个了结。</p>
<p class="p1">　　这倒是真的。有好几次，当太阳升起来的时候，他曾经以为自己劫后重生了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　但是，两眼死盯着太阳栖止的东方又何必呢，要知道，在太阳和他之间，正隔着黑夜，深不见底，爬也爬不上去啊。</p>
<p class="p1">　　十三</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>亚松森的邮政航班飞行情况良好，两点左右可以到达。可是，巴塔戈尼亚的邮政飞机似乎情况不妙，预计晚点很长时间。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>好的，里维埃先生。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我们可能不会等到这趟飞机到达就要发欧洲航班。亚松森的飞机一到，您就来取指令。做好准备吧。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃此刻又读了一遍北方站发来的安全航行的电报。电报为欧洲邮政班机铺设了一条月色朗朗的通道：<span class="s1">"</span>晴空、月圆、无风。<span class="s1">"</span>巴西的群山映照在月色皎洁的夜空中，翠绿的森林像稠密的长发洒落在大海银色的浪花上。林中的树木在月亮的光辉不倦地照耀下，青翠欲滴。一座座岛屿黑黝黝的，仿佛海上的漂浮物。高高挂在天空中的明月照亮着航道，宛如取之不竭的光源。</p>
<p class="p1">　　如果里维埃发出起飞的指令，欧洲邮政飞机的机组便会进入一个平稳的世界，整夜熠熠生辉的世界。在这个世界里，没有任何东西能够威胁黑暗和光明的平衡，就连如抚的清风也无法渗透其间。要是风力增强，万里长空在几小时内就会面目全非。</p>
<p class="p1">　　但是，里维埃面对星月交辉的夜空犹豫不决了，像勘探者面对禁止开采的金矿一样。南方发生的几件事，表明里维埃这个夜航的捍卫者错了。巴塔戈尼亚发生的一次惨剧，使其对手或许会占据道义上强者的位置，而里维埃的信念也许从此一蹶不振。里维埃的信念可是从来没有动摇过的，工作中出现的差错导致了这场悲剧，但同时这场悲剧也把问题暴露出来。悲剧证明的就是这些，而不是别的什么。<span class="s1">"</span>也许西部需要设立观测站<span class="s1">……</span>以后再说吧。<span class="s1">"</span>他还在想着，<span class="s1">"</span>我有同样充分的理由坚持下去，况且，问题已经暴露出来了，这就可以减少一个可能发生事故的原因。<span class="s1">"</span>失败使强者更坚强。不幸的是，在针对人的赌博中，事物的真正意义算分很少，决定输赢的往往是一些表面现象，并据此计算可怜的分数。这样，表面的失败把人弄得寸步难行。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃按电铃叫人。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>布兰卡港一直没有给我们发来任何消息吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>没有。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>给我接这个中途站的电话。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　五分钟后，他问道：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>为什么没有给我们把消息传过来？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我们听不到邮政班机的声音。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>它没有发报吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>不知道，雷雨太大，即使发报我们也听不到。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>特雷利乌听得到吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>听不到特雷利乌的信号。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>打电话去。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我们试过了，线路断了。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>你们那儿天气情况如何？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>暴风雨将至。西面和南面在闪电。十分闷热。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>有风吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>风还小，不过十分钟后难说。闪电迅速逼近。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　一阵沉默。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>布兰卡港吗？他们听得到吗？好的，十分钟后给我们来电话。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃翻阅南方各中途站发来的电报。所有电报都称收不到飞机的讯号。有几个中途站不再给布宜诺斯艾利斯发电报。地图上，标出无讯号区的黑点在扩大，这些地区的小城镇已经遭受台风的肆虐，家家户户大门紧闭，只有等到黎明才能将它们解救出来。</p>
<p class="p1">　　然而，里维埃俯身看着地图，指望能发现一块可供躲避的晴空，因为他已经给外省三十多个城市的警察局拍发了电报，询问天气情况，回电已陆续收到。在两千公里的航线上，话务站已接到命令，只要它们接收到飞机的信号，就必须在三十秒钟之内通知布宜诺斯艾利斯，以便将躲避位置转告给法比安。</p>
<p class="p1">　　凌晨一点，秘书们接到通知，赶回各自的办公室。他们在办公室里听到一些蹊跷的话，说是夜航飞机可能要停飞，还说什么欧洲班机天亮才起飞。他们还低声议论法比安和台风的事，特别是议论到了里维埃。他们猜他就在这儿附近，面对无中生有的谎言，一点一点地被压垮。</p>
<p class="p1">　　但是，随着里维埃出现在办公室门口，各种议论平息了。他紧裹在大衣里，帽子老是盖到眼睛上，俨然一个永远的旅人。他步子从容地朝办公室主任走去：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>一点十分了，欧洲邮政班机的材料整理好了吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">　　</span>"<span class="s2">我</span>……<span class="s2">我以为</span>……"</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>您无须以为，但要做事。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他朝一扇开着的窗户慢慢地转过身去，双手交叉放在背后。</p>
<p class="p1">　　一个秘书来到他身边：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>经理先生，我们得到的回音不会很多。我们接到通知说，内地很多电报线路已经被毁掉<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>知道了。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃一动不动，凝望着黑夜。</p>
<p class="p1">　　十四</p>
<p class="p1">　　这样，每份电报传递的消息都对邮政飞机的安全不利。每座城市在线路遭毁之前，只要能答复，都告知台风正在推进，像一支侵略军。<span class="s1">"</span>这台风起自内陆和安第斯山，一路横扫而来，直扑大海<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃觉得星星格外明亮，空气太过潮湿。多么古怪的夜晚啊！这夜晚会像光滑的水果果肉一样，突然一片片地腐烂。布宜诺斯艾利斯依然繁星满天，但这只不过是个转瞬即逝的绿洲，况且是个机组不可及的避风港。暴风雨即将来临的黑夜，狂风大作，天昏地暗。难以征服的夜。</p>
<p class="p1">　　深夜，一架飞机在某个地方遇险，飞机里的人挣扎着，无能为力。</p>
<p class="p1">　　法比安的妻子打了电话。</p>
<p class="p1">　　每逢他返航的夜晚，她都要计算巴塔戈尼亚邮政航班的行程：<span class="s1">"</span>他从特雷利乌起飞了<span class="s1">……"</span>然后，她又睡着了。过了一会儿，她又想：<span class="s1">"</span>他该飞临圣安东尼奥了，看到城市的灯火了<span class="s1">……"</span>于是，她爬起来，拉开窗帘，看看天色，<span class="s1">"</span>这一块块的乌云，不利他飞行<span class="s1">……"</span>有时，月亮在游弋，像个牧羊人。看到一轮明月和满天的星星，想到丈夫身边簇拥着千万个太空来客，少妇放心了，又躺了下来。将近一点，她感到他已近在眼前：<span class="s1">"</span>他离这儿不会太远了，该看得见布宜诺斯艾利斯了<span class="s1">……"</span>于是她又起床来，给他做饭，煮热咖啡。<span class="s1">"</span>天上那么冷<span class="s1">……"</span>她每次迎接他，总是把他当作刚从雪山顶上下来似的。<span class="s1">"</span>你不觉得冷吗？<span class="s1">""</span>不冷！<span class="s1">""</span>还是过来暖和暖和吧<span class="s1">……"</span>一点半钟左右，一切准备停当。这时，她便打电话。</p>
<p class="p1">　　这天夜里，也和往常的夜一样，她问道：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>法比安着陆了吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　接电话的秘书有点儿慌乱：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>是哪位呀？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>西蒙娜<span class="s1">·</span>法比安。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>啊！等一等<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　秘书一声也不敢吭，把听筒递给了办公室主任。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>谁呀？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>西蒙娜<span class="s1">·</span>法比安。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>啊！<span class="s1">……</span>夫人，有何贵干？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我丈夫着陆了吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　电话里一阵沉默，原因似乎不好解释，接着才很草草地回答：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>没有。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>误点了是吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>是误点了<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">　　</span>"<span class="s2">啊！</span>……"</p>
<p class="p1">　　这是一声伤及皮肉时发出的<span class="s1">"</span>啊<span class="s1">"</span>。<span class="s1">"</span>误点，这没有什么<span class="s1">……</span>没什么<span class="s1">……</span>可是，要是一直误<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>啊！<span class="s1">……</span>那么他大概几点能到达呢？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>他大概几点能到达？我们<span class="s1">……</span>我们不知道。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　这一下她可是碰壁了。她得到的只是她的问题的回声。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我请求您了，请回答我吧！他到底在哪儿？<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>他在哪儿？等一等<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　吞吞吐吐的回答使她心寒。在这堵墙壁后面，准是出了什么事。</p>
<p class="p1">　　电话的另一头终于下定决心回话：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>他是<span class="s1">19</span>点<span class="s1">30</span>分从科摩多罗起飞的。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>后来呢？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>后来？<span class="s1">……</span>耽误很久<span class="s1">……</span>因为天气不好，耽误很久<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>啊！天气不好<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>多么不公正，多么会哄人！月亮明明就挂在布宜诺斯艾利斯的上空，光彩照人，悠闲自得。<span class="s1">"</span>少妇突然想起，从科摩多罗到特雷利乌用不了两个小时。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>可是他朝特雷利乌飞去已经六个小时了！他给你们发消息了吗？他说了什么呢？<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>他对我们说什么？当然，在这种天气情况下<span class="s1">……</span>您很清楚<span class="s1">……</span>他发来的消息是听不清楚的。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>这种天气？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>这样吧，夫人，一有消息，我们马上给您打电话。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>啊！那么说你们现在什么也不知道了<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>再见，夫人<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>不，我要跟经理通话！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>夫人，经理先生很忙，他正在开会<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>啊！那我不管！我不管！我要跟他通话！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　办公室主任擦了一把汗，说：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>请等一会儿<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他推开里维埃的门：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>法比安夫人要跟您通话。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>来了，<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃心想，<span class="s1">"</span>我害怕的事真的来了。<span class="s1">"</span>悲剧中牵动感情的因素开始冒出来了。他原本想不理会这些因素，因为母亲和妻子是不能进手术室的。在遇险的船上也要控制感情，因为它无助于救人。然而他还是同意接这个电话：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>把电话接到我办公室来吧。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他倾听这个从遥远的地方传来的颤抖的声音，马上懂得他无法回答她的问题。对他俩来说，对峙下去绝对是没有结果的。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>夫人，我请您冷静些！干我们这一行的，等消息等很长时间，是常有的事。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他已经到了这样一个境地，即所涉及的不是个人痛苦的问题，而是如何对待夜航行动的问题。在里维埃跟前站着的不是法比安的妻子，而是生活的另一种含义。里维埃只能听着，只能对那细弱的声音、那如此悲戚而又怀有敌意的声调表示同情，因为夜航行动和个人幸福是不可以共存的，它们是水火不相容的。这个女人也是以一个完美世界的名义，以她的权利和义务的名义在说话的。这是一个被夜晚的桌灯照亮的世界，是一个要求肌肤之亲的世界，是怀有期望、渴求柔情、充满回忆的世界。她要求得到属于她的那一份利益，她是对的。里维埃呢，他也没有错，但他无法找出任何理由来驳倒这个女人的大实话。他也有自己的实际情况，但是，在这盏家庭用的寒碜的灯火的照耀下，他说不出口，说出来也不近人情。</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">　　</span>"<span class="s2">夫人</span>……"</p>
<p class="p1">　　她再也不听了。他似乎感觉到，她在用柔弱的拳头对抗着擂了一阵之后，倒了下来，几乎倒在他的脚下。</p>
<p class="p1">　　一天，在一座施工中的桥梁旁有人受了伤。里维埃和一位工程师俯身察看伤者的时候，工程师对他说：<span class="s1">"</span>建一座桥以砸伤一个人的脸为代价，值得吗？<span class="s1">"</span>不错，这条路是给农民开的，但是走这座桥少绕了一个弯，而这张脸却被弄得面目全非，也不会有哪个农民答应。话是这么说，一座座的桥梁仍然在建。工程师补充说：<span class="s1">"</span>整体的利益是由个体利益组成的，但是整体利益也要维护个体利益。<span class="s1">""</span>不过，<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃过了一会儿回答说，<span class="s1">"</span>人的生命固然宝贵，但是我们在工作中总是觉得有某些东西比人的生命更可贵<span class="s1">……</span>但究竟是什么呢？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　就这样，里维埃在想到那个机组的时候，心情十分难过。工作，即使是造桥的工作，也会把幸福毁灭掉。里维埃再也不能不扪心自问：<span class="s1">"</span>犯得着这样做吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>这些也许行将消失的人，<span class="s1">"</span>他想，<span class="s1">"</span>本来会过上幸福的生活。<span class="s1">"</span>他看到夜灯下金光闪闪的圣所里一张张歪斜的脸。<span class="s1">"</span>我凭什么把他们从圣所里拉出来？<span class="s1">"</span>他凭什么夺走个人的幸福呢？第一部法律不正是要保护这类幸福的吗？而他却要摧毁这些幸福。当然，总有一天，这些金光闪闪的圣所也会命中注定要像海市蜃楼一样烟消云散。衰老和死亡会比他更加无情地摧毁它们。也许会有一些有待拯救的，更加持久的东西。或许里维埃所从事的正是拯救吧？不然，他的工作就毫无意义了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>爱，仅仅有爱，无疑是死胡同一条！<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃暗暗地感到，有一种义务，它比爱更重要。或者说，这是一种温情，但与其他温情截然不同。他想起了这么一句话：<span class="s1">"</span>问题在于使它们变成永恒<span class="s1">……"</span>他在什么地方读到这句话的呢？<span class="s1">"</span>您内心孜孜以求的东西正在消亡。<span class="s1">"</span>他眼前再次出现秘鲁古代印卡帝国（译注：此处指哥伦布发现美洲新大陆前的印卡帝国。印卡帝国<span class="s1">15</span>世纪以后在秘鲁达到鼎盛时期，<span class="s1">16</span>世纪被西班牙征服。）的太阳神庙。一块块的石头矗立在高山上。那显赫的文明，以其块块巨石之重，压在今天人类的身上，令人悔恨交加。若是没有这些石块，古代文明还剩下什么呢？<span class="s1">"</span>古代百姓的头领，凭什么铁石心肠，或者奇特的爱意，迫使他的臣民把这座神庙搬到山上来，并使他们自己也流芳百世呢？<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃又在浮想联翩，仿佛又看见小城的百姓在音乐厅旁转悠。<span class="s1">"</span>这一类的幸福，这一副枷锁<span class="s1">……"</span>他想。古代百姓的头领对人的疾苦并不体恤，而对人的死亡却无限痛惜。他并不是痛惜某个人的死去，而是痛惜整个人类将被沙海湮没。于是，他带领百姓至少垒起了石块，使沙漠无法掩埋。</p>
<p class="p1">　　十五</p>
<p class="p1">　　这张折成四角的纸也许会救他一命。法比安把纸打开，牙齿咬得紧紧的。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>无法与布宜诺斯艾利斯取得联系，连发报机也操纵不了，手指一接触就起火星。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　法比安一看就火了，想回答，可是，手松开操纵杆写字时，有一股强烈的气浪吹透他的全身，涡流将他连同他置身的五吨重的钢铁一起托起，摇晃着。他只好作罢。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他又一次用双手挡住气浪，减少气浪的冲击。</p>
<p class="p1">　　法比安大口地呼吸着。要是报务员因为害怕雷雨而把天线收回去，法比安到机场后非得狠狠地抽他的脸不可。要不惜一切代价与布宜诺斯艾利斯联系上，联系上了，就像在一千五百公里以外也能朝深渊里给他们抛去一条绳子一样。没有摇曳的光线，看不到小旅馆的灯火，（灯火虽然用处不大，但也能像一座导航灯一样证实下面就是陆地）他最少也要听到声音，采自已不复存在的那个世界的声音，哪怕仅仅一声也好。飞行员扬起拳头在红色的灯光下摇晃着，想让坐在后面的另一个人明白悲哀的真实情况，但是他却俯身看着遭风雨蹂躏的天空，被大雪埋没的城市和熄灭了的灯光，不知道发生了什么。</p>
<p class="p1">　　法比安什么忠告都会听，只要有人大声对他说出来。他想：<span class="s1">"</span>如果有人让我盘旋，我就盘旋；让我朝正南飞<span class="s1">……"</span>皓月下宁静、温馨的乐土，就在某个地方。那里的伙伴正在美如花朵的灯光下俯身查看地图，他们一个个都像无所不能的饱学之士，对这些乐土了如指掌。而他呢，除了涡流和夹着黑色激流的黑夜以排山倒海之势向他冲来之外，还知道什么？他们不会把正在龙卷风和烈焰之中挣扎的这两个人扔在云层里不管。他们不能这样做。他们会给法比安发出指令：<span class="s1">"</span>航向二百四十<span class="s1">……"</span>然后他按照指令把航向定在二百四十。可是他只有自己一个人。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他觉得飞机也反水了。每次下降时，发动机晃得十分厉害，整架飞机像发怒一样震动起来。法比安一头埋进座舱里，面朝陀螺仪显示的视野，使尽力气控制飞机，因为，飞机外，天和地陷入一片混沌中，陷入开天辟地时代的黑暗中，让他分辨不清。但是，方位仪的指针摆动愈来愈快，飞行员很难看得清楚，结果驾驶不当，飞行高度下降，渐渐地陷入黑暗中。他看到飞行高度是<span class="s1">"</span>五百米<span class="s1">"</span>，正好是山丘的高度。他感到山丘令人眩昏的气浪正向他滚滚袭来。他也明白，在这个高度上，所有的山包包，哪怕是最小的，也会把他砸个粉身碎骨。这些山包包像被连根拔起，没有了依靠，正醉醺醺地在他周围打转，并且开始跳起一种深奥的舞蹈，把他挤得越来越紧。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他横下一条心，准备冒着机毁人亡的危险．降落在任何地方。但是，为了避免撞到山上，他打出了唯一的一颗照明弹。照明弹燃烧起来，旋转着，把平原照亮，然后落在海里熄灭。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他飞快地想：<span class="s1">"</span>完了，我修正了四十度，还是偏离了方向。旋风刮起来了。陆地在哪儿？<span class="s1">"</span>他转向正西方。他想：<span class="s1">"</span>没有照明弹，我简直是在玩命。<span class="s1">"</span>总有一天会把小命搭上的。而他那坐在后排的伙伴<span class="s1">……"</span>他把天线收回来了，准会收回来的。<span class="s1">"</span>但飞行员不再抱怨他。只要他一松手，他们的性命马上就会陷落下去，像一粒无用的微尘一样。他的手中掌握着伙伴跳动的心和他自己的心。可是突然间，他的双手让他害怕起来。</p>
<p class="p1">　　涡流像撞锤一样冲击。为了减少震动，他紧紧抓住方向盘，否则操纵杆会被震坏的。他原先死死地抓住操纵杆不放，现在仍然抓着。由于用力过度，他感到双手没有了知觉。他想活动活动指头，看看有没有感觉，却不知道它们是不是听使唤。但是他的双臂的末端却像不是长在自己身上一样，简直像个没有知觉的软绵绵的橡皮囊。他想：<span class="s1">"</span>我得使劲地想象是在抓住<span class="s1">……"</span>他不知道自己的想法能不能够传到双手上，只是肩膀疼痛才感觉到方向盘在震动。<span class="s1">"</span>我快要抓不住了。我的手要松开了<span class="s1">……"</span>但是他竟然说这样的话，心里感到害怕，因为他以为感觉到了双手这一回听从神奇力量的指使，在黑暗中慢慢松开，把他丢出来。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他本来还是可以抗争的，可以碰碰运气，因为外界的宿命论是没有的，只有内心的宿命论，它就在人发现自己脆弱的一瞬间发生，这样，您就会像昏了头一样被种种错误吸附。</p>
<p class="p1">　　也就在这一瞬间，在暴风雨撕开的口子中，有几颗星星在他的头上闪闪发亮，但都像是放在捕鱼篓底的毒饵。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他明知道是个陷阱，因为他看到窟窿里有三颗星星，于是便朝那儿飞去，然后就下不来了，只好停留在那儿啃星星<span class="s1">……</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　但是，对光明的渴望，使他不顾一切地飞上去。</p>
<p class="p1">　　十六</p>
<p class="p1">　　他依靠星星的指引，努力避开涡流，往上飞去。星星像磁铁一样吸引着他。他苦苦地追寻光明，追寻了那么久，所以，任何亮光，哪怕是再模糊的亮光，他也不会放弃。只要看见旅馆的灯光一片亮堂，他就会追随这个渴望的标志物一直到死。这不，他正朝着明亮的天宇飞上去。</p>
<p class="p1">　　在头顶上的这一口一张一合的井里，他盘旋着慢慢往上飞。飞机升得越高，云块就越是被褪去它那乌泥般的色彩，像洁白的浪花一样冲他而来。法比安终于从云层里钻了出来。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他诧异极了：天空竟然这么明亮，让他眼花缭乱。他不得不把眼睛闭上了一阵子。他怎么也想不到，云朵在夜晚也会令人目眩。但是，一轮圆月和满天的繁星把云朵嬗变为灿烂的波涛。</p>
<p class="p1">　　就在他从云层里钻出来的那一瞬间，飞机一下子平稳了，平稳得异乎寻常，没有一点儿浪涛使飞机倾斜，宛如一叶扁舟越过堤坝进入水库里的水面一样。他身处不被人了解、藏而不露的天空的一隅，仿佛一座幸福的港湾。飞机下面是另一个世界，在三千米的范围里，狂风大作，电闪雷鸣，雨水如注，但是，在面对着星辰的这一空间，却是一派晶莹剔透。</p>
<p class="p1">　　法比安以为身临奇异的仙境，因为他的手、身穿的衣服，还有飞机的翼翅都闪闪发亮。这亮光并非来自星星，而是在他的下面、他的四周，从雪白的云朵里释放出来。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他下面的这些云朵，把它们从月亮里接收到的所有白光反射回去。右边和左边那些如铁塔一般高高挂着的云朵也是如此。空中飘荡着的乳白色亮光，洒落在机组人员身上。法比安回过头去，看见报务员笑眯眯的。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>现在好多了！<span class="s1">"</span>他大声地说。</p>
<p class="p1">　　但是，声音被飞机的轰鸣声吞没，只有微笑在传递心声。<span class="s1">"</span>我简直是疯了，<span class="s1">"</span>法比安想，<span class="s1">"</span>笑疯了。我们完了。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　然而，千百双黑糊糊的臂膀把他松开。他像个囚徒一样被松了绑，暂时得以独自在花丛中走一走。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>太美了。<span class="s1">"</span>法比安心想。在一个除了他法比安和他的伙伴之外绝对没有任何人的世界里，他在像财宝一样密密麻麻地堆积在一起的星星之间徜徉着，仿佛神话世界中城里的小偷，被关在装满金银的屋子里出不来。他们在冷冰的宝石之间游荡，虽然家累千金，但命运却已注定。</p>
<p class="p1">　　十七</p>
<p class="p1">　　巴塔戈尼亚航线上的一个名叫科摩多罗<span class="s1">·</span>里瓦达维亚的中途站，一位无线电报务员突然打了个手势，于是，所有守候着飞机消息的束手无策的人，便马上围了过来，俯下身子。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他们俯身看一张被强烈的灯光照射的白纸，报务员的手还在犹豫，铅笔摇晃着，他的手还没有在纸上写出字来，手指已经抖得厉害。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>是雷雨吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　报务员点头说<span class="s1">"</span>是<span class="s1">"</span>。雷雨的轰鸣声太大，他没有听清楚。</p>
<p class="p1">　　接着，他记下了一些无法辨认的符号，接着才变成字，最后才凑成一篇电文，内容是这样的：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>受困于暴风雨之上三千八百米高空。因偏航到海上，现向正西飞往内地。下方已被乌云遮住。不知是否仍在海上飞行。盼告知暴风雨是否扩延至内陆。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　因为雷雨的关系，要把这封电报转往布宜诺斯艾利斯，只好一站一站地传送了。就这样，这消息在黑夜中像烽火台的烽火一样传递出去。</p>
<p class="p1">　　布宜诺斯艾利斯方面通过别的途径回话说：<span class="s1">"</span>内陆普遍有暴风雨。汽油还剩下多少？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>够飞半个小时。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　于是，这句话又由一个<span class="s1">-</span>个值夜班的人传回布宜诺斯艾利斯。</p>
<p class="p1">　　机组注定在三十分钟之内就被卷进台风里，摔落地面。</p>
<p class="p1">　　十八</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃思索着。他不再抱有希望，因为机组会在黑夜里坠落某个地方。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃记得儿时给他留下的一个很深的印象：人们抽干池塘的水寻找一具尸体。但是，在黑夜从地面流逝之前，在沙石、平原和麦田重现于阳光下之前，他们什么也找不到。也许今后会有一些普通农民发现两个孩子弯臂抱脸，在一片静谧的景色中，躺在草地和金色的麦田之间，仿佛是在睡觉。可是，黑夜却把他们吞噬了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃想到如同被埋在神奇的大海一样被埋在黑夜深处的宝藏。<span class="s1">……</span>黑夜里，那些枝头挂满了花儿的苹果树，正在盼望着白天的到来。黑夜内涵丰富，香气四溢，到处是熟睡的羊羔以及还没有色泽的花朵。</p>
<p class="p1">　　慢慢地，初升的太阳就要照耀肥沃的犁沟、湿润的树林和鲜嫩的金花菜。可是，就在如今不再伤人的山丘之间，在辽阔的平原上，在羊群当中，在智慧的世界里，有两个孩子像是在睡觉。有些东西就要从眼前的世界飘移到另一个世界。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃理解法比安的妻子，她温柔多情，焦虑不安。这份爱情简直是租借给她的，就像是一件借给穷孩子的玩具。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃想到法比安的手。这只抓住操纵杆的手能够把自己的命运掌握几分钟。这只手曾经用来爱抚过另一个人。这只手曾经停留在那一方酥胸上，像一只圣手，引起了冲动。这只手也曾落在一张脸上，并改变了这张脸。这只手真是神奇。</p>
<p class="p1">　　法比安在磅礴的云海中遨游。夜间。而下面却是永恒。他独自置身于星座之间，辨不清方向。他现在还能把世界掌握在自己手里，稳稳地搂在怀中。他把人类财宝的重负全押在方向盘上，绝望地带着必须归还的无用之财，越过一颗颗的星星<span class="s1">……</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃想，还会有无线电台能听到他的消息。维系着法比安和这个世界的，便是这音乐般的电波和微弱的声音。没有呻吟，没有呼喊，唯有绝望曾经发出的最纯净的声音。</p>
<p class="p1">　　十九</p>
<p class="p1">　　鲁比诺打破了他的孤寂。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>经理先生，我想过了<span class="s1">……</span>咱们也许可以试一试<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他其实并没有什么新主意，只是以此表表好意而已。他多么想找出办法，他也像猜谜语般地找着，但他找到的办法总是里维埃不喜欢听的。<span class="s1">"</span>鲁比诺，看到了吧，生活中实际上并没有什么办法，只有各种因素在起作用，要努力创造这些因素，这样办法就会随之而来。<span class="s1">"</span>所以，鲁比诺便把自己的角色定位于在机械师圈子中创造一种进取力量，一种微薄的进取力量，保证螺旋桨毂不生锈。</p>
<p class="p1">　　但是，这一夜发生的事让鲁比诺束手无策。他的督察员头衔没有赋予他任何战胜雷雨的力量，也无法帮助这个幽灵般的机组。说实在的，机组现在不是在为领准点奖而搏斗，而是为了逃脱唯一的惩罚，这种惩罚会使鲁比诺的处罚失去意义<span class="s1">--</span>死亡。</p>
<p class="p1">　　于是，眼下没有了用处的鲁比诺只好在办公室里踱步，无所事事。</p>
<p class="p1">　　法比安的妻子上门求见。她焦急难耐，来到秘书的办公室，等待里维埃的接见。秘书们偷偷地抬头看她的脸。她感到不好意思，害怕地看着四周。这儿的一切都不欢迎她。这些男人一个劲地在工作，仿佛只顾踏着一具尸体往前走，记载着人的生命和人间疾苦的资料只剩下冷冰冰的数字残渣。她找寻能告诉她法比安消息的迹象。家里的一切都显示他不在，床上的被子掀开一半，咖啡煮好了没有人喝，摆着的一束花开始枯萎<span class="s1">……</span>她没有看到显示他在家的东西。一切都与怜悯、友谊、记忆相悖。她听到的唯一的一句话（因为没有人在她面前抬高声音说话）是一个职员要清单时说的粗话：<span class="s1">"……</span>发电机的清单，见鬼！是我们发往桑托斯那批货的清单。<span class="s1">"</span>她抬头看着这个人，神情十分惊讶，然后又看了挂在墙上的地图。她的嘴唇有点儿颤抖，但几乎察觉不出来。</p>
<p class="p1">　　她揣测来这里遭到了敌视，几乎后悔自己来了。她真想躲起来。她害怕太过引人注目，所以拼命忍住咳嗽和哭泣。她发觉自己像是没有穿衣服一样别扭，很不体面。她感到很难堪。但是她太显眼了，引得那些躲躲闪闪的目光不厌其烦地往她脸上瞟。这个女人长得很漂亮，她向男人们展示着一个幸福的奇妙世界，同时也宣示，大家这样做，不知不觉地伤害的是何等神圣的东西。面对来自四面八方的目光，她闭上了眼睛。她要表明，人们无意中会把什么样的安宁毁掉。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃接待了她。</p>
<p class="p1">　　她羞怯地来申诉理由，说摆放的鲜花已枯萎，煮好的咖啡没人喝，自己鲜嫩的肉体无人享用。在这间还要更冷的办公室里，她又一次感到嘴唇在颤动。她也发现，自己的道理在另一个世界无法表达。在她身上涌动的近乎野性的、如此的强烈的情欲，还有一片忠贞之心，到了这里像是换上了一副自私的可憎面孔。她直想逃跑。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>打扰您了<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>夫人，<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃对她说，<span class="s1">"</span>您没有打扰我。遗憾的是，夫人，您和我除了等待以外，没有别的好办法。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　她微耸肩膀，里维埃马上懂得了她的意思：<span class="s1">"</span>我回去面对这盏灯、这顿做好的晚饭、这些花，又有什么用呢<span class="s1">……"</span>一位年轻的母亲有一天曾经向里维埃说出心里话：<span class="s1">"</span>我的孩子死了，我还没有明白过来是怎么回事。看见他用过的一件件小东西，比如我翻出的小衣服，是最令人难受的。晚上如果醒过来，心中依然涌起一股温情，但是这股温情和我的奶水一样今后派不上用场了<span class="s1">……"</span>对于这个女人也是如此，法比安的死也许明天刚刚开始，这样，到时他就会通过每一个失去意义的动作、每一件物件，慢慢地离开自己的家。里维埃把同情深深地埋在心里。</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">　　</span>"<span class="s2">夫人</span>……"</p>
<p class="p1">　　少妇带着几乎卑谦的笑容退了出去，她不知道自己究竟有多重的分量。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃坐了下来，心情有些沉重。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>可是她在帮助我发现我要找的东西<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他心不在焉地轻轻拍打北方各中途站传来的安全措施的电报。他想：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我们不要求永留青史，但不要出现行为和事物突然失去它们意义的情况。否则，我们周围的空虚就会显现<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他的目光落在电报上，说：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>瞧，死神就是从这儿，从这些不再含有意义的信息里钻到我们中间的<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他看着鲁比诺。这个平庸的小伙子，现在毫无用处，再也没有意义了。里维埃用几乎生硬的语气对他说：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>您的工作难道要我亲自给您分派吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　然后，里维埃推开通往秘书室的门。法比安的失踪已经通过明白无误的符号映入他的眼帘，但是，法比安夫人并不会看。法比安驾驶的<span class="s1">R.B.903</span>号飞机的卡片已经贴在墙上的飞行调度图中无法使用物资一栏。正在为这架欧洲航班准备材料的秘书们明知飞机将延误，工作起来懒懒散散。机场方面打来电话，询问有什么指令下达给无所事事的值班人员。生活的节拍放慢了。<span class="s1">"</span>要问什么是死，这就是死了！<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃想。他的工作就像一条在无风的海面上出了故障的帆船。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他听到了鲁比诺的声音：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>经理先生<span class="s1">……</span>他们结婚才六个星期<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>干活去。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃始终看着秘书们，并越过秘书们看着工人、机械师、飞行员以及所有怀着建设者信念帮助他工作的人。他想到从前的那些小城，小城一听说有<span class="s1">"</span>岛屿<span class="s1">"</span>，就为自己造一艘船，来承载他们的希望，让人们能够看到他们的希望在大海上扬帆航行。有了这艘船，大家变得伟大，超越自我，得到解脱。<span class="s1">"</span>目的也许不能证明什么，但行动却能将人从死亡之中拯救出来。这些人也通过自己的船永垂千古。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　而当里维埃重新赋予电报充分的意义，让值班人员恢复紧张的工作，让飞行员飞往悲壮的目的地的时候；当生命就像海风重新吹动帆船一样再度使这一事业充满勃勃生机的时候，他也会与死神展开搏斗。</p>
<p class="p1">　　二十</p>
<p class="p1">　　科摩多罗<span class="s1">·</span>里瓦达维亚方面什么也听不到了。但是，二十分钟之后，在距离那儿一千公里以外的巴亚<span class="s1">·</span>布兰卡港却接收到第二份电报：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>正在下降，进入云层<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　接着，特雷利乌的无线电台又收到了几个意义不清的字：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>看见<span class="s1">……</span>什么也没有<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　无线电短波往往就是这样，那边收到了，这儿却跟聋子一样。接着，一切又无缘无故地改变了。这个方位不明的机组，在生者看来，已经身处时间和空间之外，而在无线电讯站的空白纸上，写字的都已是一些幽灵了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　汽油是否已经耗尽？或者飞行员遇到机械故障了，要打出最后一张牌，安全迫降？</p>
<p class="p1">　　这时，传来了布宜诺斯艾利斯方面向特雷利乌发出指令的声音：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>向他们把情况了解清楚。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　无线电监听站活像一座实验室，满屋子都是镍、铜和压力计，还有传输线管，值班人员穿着白大褂，默不作声，仿佛埋头做一个简单的实验。</p>
<p class="p1">　　他们用轻巧的手触摸仪器，探索出现磁场的太空。他们简直就像寻找金矿脉的魔法师。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>没有回答吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>没有回答。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他们或许会捕捉到这个意味着人还活着的音符。如果飞机飞到星星中间，飞机上的灯光还在亮，他们也许就能听到这颗星星在歌唱<span class="s1">……</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　时间一分一秒地过去，真像鲜血一样流失。天上的飞机还在飞吗？每一秒钟都带走一分机会。唉，流逝的时间简直是要把机会断送，它花一两千年侵蚀一座庙宇，先磨耗花岗岩石，最后让庙宇化为尘土。如今，几个世纪的磨耗力量集中在每一秒钟，威胁着机组的安全。</p>
<p class="p1">　　每一秒钟都带走一些东西。</p>
<p class="p1">　　也带走法比安的声音，他的笑容和他的微笑。天地无声。无声世界越来越沉重，像大海一样压在机组身上。</p>
<p class="p1">　　这时，有人提醒道：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>一点四十分了。是汽油使用的最后极限，他们不可能再飞了。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　又是一片沉默。</p>
<p class="p1">　　大家的嘴唇上有股苦涩的感觉，很不是滋味，仿佛旅程结束时一样。已经发生了某件事情，但是大家一无所知，那是令人作呕的事情。身处这堆镍和铜管线路之间，大家感到一丝凄凉，就像站在一座工厂的废墟里一样。这些材料很压抑，没有用，丢弃了也不可惜，就像一堆枯树枝。</p>
<p class="p1">　　现在只好等待天亮了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　再过几个小时，阿根廷全境就会在阳光下显现。这些人呆在那儿，就像呆在海滩上，面朝渔网，拉呀拉，慢慢地拉，但是网着什么却不知道。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃在办公室里感到精神一阵轻松。人的这种感觉只有在经过了大灾难，不再受命运的折磨之后才能体会到。他已经让人向全省各地的警方报了警。他再也无能为力了，只好等待。</p>
<p class="p1">　　但是，即使是在办丧事的人家也得有个秩序。里维埃向鲁比诺打了个手势：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>给北方各中途站拍发电报，内容如下：预计巴塔戈尼亚的邮政班机将长时间延误。为了不过多耽误欧洲邮政班机起飞，拟将巴塔戈尼亚的邮件交由下一班欧洲班机一并发运。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他微微弯腰向前。但是，他一使劲便记起一件事来，这事还挺严重的啊！对了。可不要忘记了。他说：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>鲁比诺。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃先生，什么事？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>您起草一个通知，禁止飞行员让马达转速超过一千九百转，否则就是在糟蹋我的马达。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>好的，里维埃先生。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃的身子更弯了。他需要安静，这比什么都重要。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>去吧，鲁比诺，好，老弟<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　在死亡的阴影面前的这种平等关系，使鲁比诺感到害怕。</p>
<p class="p1">　　二十一</p>
<p class="p1">　　鲁比诺现在在各个办公室里走来走去，心情忧郁。既然原定夜里两点起飞的邮政航班要推迟到白天出发，那么，公司生计就停顿下来了。紧绷着脸的职员还在值班，但值班也是白搭。北方各中途站的电报还能不断地收到，但是他们说的<span class="s1">"</span>晴天<span class="s1">"</span>、<span class="s1">"</span>月圆<span class="s1">"</span>、<span class="s1">"</span>无风<span class="s1">"</span>却给人一种不毛之地的印象，简直就是一片只有月亮和石头的荒漠。当鲁比诺翻阅（自己也不知道为什么翻阅）办公室主任正在准备的一份材料的时候，他瞥见他正站在自己的对面，带着尊敬而傲慢的神情等他把材料归还他，那样子好像在说：<span class="s1">"</span>您可以还给我，对吧，我还得<span class="s1">……"</span>下级的这种态度让督察员感到不快，但他一句话也不说，快快地把材料递了过去。他转过身仪态万方地坐下。<span class="s1">"</span>我本来应该把他打发走。<span class="s1">"</span>鲁比诺心想。于是，他怕失态，便走了几步，同时想着这场悲剧。这场悲剧会导致某项政策失势，所以鲁比诺要为双重祸事而伤心。</p>
<p class="p1">　　然后，他又想起那位关在办公室里曾经对他说过<span class="s1">"</span>我的老弟<span class="s1">……"</span>的里维埃的样子。人从来没有孤独无援到这步田地。鲁比诺顿起深深的恻隐之心，便在脑子里搜寻几句隐含同情和安慰的话。一种他认为很高尚的情感激励着他。于是他轻轻地敲门，但没有回答。他不敢敲得重一点，四周太静了。他推开门，里维埃在里面。鲁比诺平生第一回以平等的身份走进他的办公室，有点儿像朋友，也有点儿像想象中冒着炮火找到了受伤的将军、护送他撤退并且在落泊中成为他的兄弟的一名中士。<span class="s1">"</span>不管发生什么情况，我永远和您在一起。<span class="s1">"</span>鲁比诺真想这么说。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃一声不吭，低头看着自己的手。鲁比诺站在他跟前，却不敢张口说话。雄狮即使被制伏，也会把他吓坏。他酝酿着几句表忠心的话，但是，每次举目，看见的是这颗低垂的脑袋、这头灰白的头发和两片紧抿的嘴唇，他想他该忍受多大的痛苦啊！末了，他才打定主意说：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>经理先生<span class="s1">……"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃抬起头看着他。他刚陷人沉思中，想得很远，及至鲁比诺进来他才如梦初醒，也许还根本没有注意到他的出现。他做什么梦，心中有什么感受，服什么丧，谁也不知道，永远不知道。里维埃久久地望着鲁比诺，仿佛他是某件事的活证人。鲁比诺很不自在。里维埃越是看着鲁比诺，鲁比诺的脸就越红，并且，在里维埃看来，就更像是抱着感人但可惜是自发的好意，来这儿表明人的愚蠢。</p>
<p class="p1">　　鲁比诺慌乱起来。中士也好，将军也好，炮火也好，全都忘得一干二净了。有些事情是很难解释清楚的。里维埃一直盯着他。鲁比诺不由自主地调整了态度，将手从左边的口袋里抽出来。里维埃仍然看着他。鲁比诺感到十分不自在，却不知道何故。最后，他才说：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>我是来听您的指示的。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃掏出手表，简要地说：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>现在是两点。亚松森的邮政班机两点十分着陆。让欧洲邮政航班两点一刻起飞吧。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　于是，鲁比诺把这一惊人消息传播开了：夜航没有取消。他对办公室主任说：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>请您把材料送给我，我来检查一下。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　可是当办公室主任来到他跟前的时候，他却说：</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>等一等。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　于是，办公室主任就等着。</p>
<p class="p1">　　二十二</p>
<p class="p1">　　亚松森的邮政航班报告马上着陆。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃即使在情况最糟糕的时候，也每封电报必读，关注着飞机的安全航行。在一片惊慌失措中，飞机安全航行对他的信念是一种报答，是明证。这次飞行顺利，通过一封封电报，预告着千万次其他飞行也会顺利。<span class="s1">"</span>台风不是每天夜里都有的。<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃也在想：<span class="s1">"</span>路子一旦走出来，就会继续走下去。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　飞机飞过巴拉圭一个个中途站往下降，像是飞经一座鲜花盛开、别墅点点、湖光潋滟的可爱花园。飞机擦着旋风的边缘下滑，连一颗星星也没有遮住。九名乘客裹着旅行毯，前额像贴在摆满珠宝的橱窗上一样贴着舷窗往下看，因为阿根廷的一座座像星星一样的小城，夜里在群星淡淡的光照下，金光灿灿。飞行员坐在前舱，双手担负着人命关天的重担，眼睛睁得大大的，眼睛里面泻满了月光，活像一个牧羊人。布宜诺斯艾利斯已经出现在粉红的地平线上，城里的建筑不久也会像神奇的宝石一样大放异彩。报务员用手指摁出最后几份电报，仿佛他在天际快活地弹出的一支奏鸣曲的最后几个音符。里维埃懂得这些曲调。接着，他收起天线，伸了懒腰，打个哈欠，微笑着说：到了。</p>
<p class="p1">　　飞行员着陆后又见到了欧洲邮政航班的飞行员，他靠着飞机，双手插在口袋里。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>是你接着飞吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>是的。<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>巴塔戈尼亚的飞机到达了吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>不等了，已经失踪了。那边天气好吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>好极了。法比安失踪了吗？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　这事他们很少谈论。他们之间有着深厚的情谊，他们无需用话语表达。</p>
<p class="p1">　　亚松森的邮包被转装到欧洲航班上。飞行员仍然一动不动，仰着头，身子靠在座舱上，望着星空。他感到身上滋生了一种无边的力量，并出现了强烈的快感。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>装完了？<span class="s1">"</span>一个声音问道，<span class="s1">"</span>那就发动吧！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　飞行员没有动。有人替他把发动机发动起来。飞行员就要透过靠着飞机的肩膀，感觉到飞机要活起来了。在听到那么多<span class="s1">"</span>飞<span class="s1">……</span>不飞<span class="s1">……</span>飞<span class="s1">"</span>的反复无常的消息后，现在他终于相信要出发了。他的嘴微微张开，牙齿在月光下闪亮，像一只年幼的猛兽。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>夜里要多加小心，嗯！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　他没有听到伙伴的忠告，双手仍然插在口袋里，仰头面对云朵、高山、鲜花和大海，无声地笑了起来。笑声虽然很轻，却传遍全身，仿佛微风吹过青草，让他整个人战栗起来。笑声虽然很轻，却比眼前的云朵、高山、鲜花和大海更有威力。</p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>你怎么啦？<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　<span class="s1">"</span>里维埃这个笨蛋，他把我<span class="s1">……</span>他以为我害怕！<span class="s1">"</span></p>
<p class="p1">　　二十三</p>
<p class="p1">　　一分钟之后，他就飞出布宜诺斯艾利斯。重新投入战斗的里维埃想听到他的声音，听到这声音诞生、咆哮并消失。这声音像一支向星星挺进的军队迈出的雄壮的脚步声。</p>
<p class="p1">　　里维埃交叉着双臂，从秘书中间穿过。他来到一扇窗前，停住脚步，侧耳细听，陷入深思。</p>
<p class="p1">　　如果他停掉哪怕一次飞行，夜航事业就会前功尽弃，处于下风的人明天就会攻击他。但是，他抢在弱者之前，夜里就放飞了这一个机组。</p>
<p class="p1">　　胜利<span class="s1">……</span>失败<span class="s1">……</span>这些字眼毫无意义。生活就是这个样子，但是正在酝酿以全新的面貌出现。一次胜利会削弱一个民族，一次失败却会唤醒另一个民族。里维埃遭遇的失败也许是一个契机，会把真正的胜利拉近。事情进展顺利，这才是最重要的。</p>
<p class="p1">　　五分钟后，无线电台将会向各中途站发出通知。在一万五千公里的航线上，生命的激情将会把所有的问题化解。</p>
<p class="p1">　　于是，里维埃迈开从容的步子，穿过秘书中间，回办公室工作。面对他严厉的目光，秘书们一个个都低下了头。大人物里维埃，战无不胜的里维埃，他的胜利扛得好沉重。</p>

<p class="p3">Night Flight</p>

<p class="p3">Already<span class="s2">,</span> Beneath Him<span class="s2">,</span> Through the Golden Evening -</p>
<p class="p3">Already<span class="s2">,</span> beneath him<span class="s2">,</span> through the golden evening<span class="s2">,</span> the shadowed hills had dug their furrows and the plains grew luminous with long-enduring light. For in these lands the ground gives off this golden glow persistently<span class="s2">,</span> just as<span class="s2">,</span> even when winter goes<span class="s2">,</span> the whiteness of the snow persists.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Fabien<span class="s2">,</span> the pilot bringing the Patagonia air-mail from the far south to Buenos Aires<span class="s2">,</span> could mark night coming on by certain signs that called to mind the waters of a harbor - a calm expanse beneath<span class="s2">,</span> faintly rippled by the lazy clouds - and he seemed to be entering a vast anchorage<span class="s2">,</span> an immensity of blessedness.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Or else he might have fancied he was taking a quiet walk in the calm of evening<span class="s2">,</span> almost like a shepherd. The Patagonian shepherds move<span class="s2">,</span> unhurried<span class="s2">,</span> from one flock to another<span class="s2">;</span> and he<span class="s2">,</span> too<span class="s2">,</span> moved from one town to another<span class="s2">,</span> the shepherd of those little towns. Every two hours he met another of them<span class="s2">,</span> drinking at its riverside or browsing on its plain.</p>
<p class="p3">Sometimes<span class="s2">,</span> after a hundred miles of steppes as desolate as the sea<span class="s2">,</span> he encountered a lonely farm-house that seemed to be sailing backwards from him in a great prairie sea<span class="s2">,</span> with its freight of human lives<span class="s2">;</span> and he saluted with his wings this passing ship.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>"San Julian in sight. In ten minutes we shall land."</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>The wireless operator gave their position to all the stations on the line. From Magellan Strait to Buenos Aires the airports were strung out across fifteen hundred miles and more<span class="s2">,</span> but this one led toward the frontiers of night<span class="s2">,</span> just as in Africa the last conquered hamlet opens on to the unknown.</p>
<p class="p3">The wireless operator handed the pilot a slip of paper: "There are so many storms about that the discharges are fouling my ear-phones. Shall we stop the night at San Julian<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">Fabien smiled<span class="s2">;</span> the sky was calm as an aquarium and all the stations ahead were signaling<span class="s2">,</span> <span class="s2">“</span>Clear sky: no wind.<span class="s2">”</span></p>
<p class="p3">"No<span class="s2">,</span> we'll go on."</p>
<p class="p3">But the wireless operator was thinking: these storms had lodged themselves some­where or other<span class="s2">,</span> as worms do in a fruit<span class="s2">;</span> a fine night<span class="s2">,</span> but they would ruin it<span class="s2">,</span> and he loathed entering this shadow that was ripe to rotten­ness.</p>
<p class="p3">As he slowed down his engine for the San Julian landing<span class="s2">,</span> Fabien knew that he was tired. All that endeared his life to man was looming up to meet him<span class="s2">;</span> men's houses<span class="s2">,</span> friendly little cafes<span class="s2">,</span> trees under which they walk. He was like some conqueror who<span class="s2">,</span> in the aftermath of victory<span class="s2">,</span> bends down upon his territories and now perceives the humble happiness of men. A need came over Fabien to lay his weapons down and feel the aching burden of his limbs — for even our misfor­tunes are a part of our belongings — and to stay<span class="s2">,</span> a simple dweller here<span class="s2">,</span> watching from his window a scene that would never change. This tiny village<span class="s2">,</span> he could gladly have made friends with it<span class="s2">;</span> the choice once made<span class="s2">,</span> a man accepts the issue of his venture and can love the life. Like love<span class="s2">,</span> it hems him in. Fabien would have wished to live a long while here — here to possess his morsel of eternity. These little towns<span class="s2">,</span> where he lived an hour<span class="s2">,</span> their gardens girdled by old walls over which he passed<span class="s2">,</span> seemed something apart and everlasting. Now the village was rising to meet the plane<span class="s2">,</span> opening out toward him. And there<span class="s2">,</span> he mused<span class="s2">,</span> were friendliness and gentle girls<span class="s2">,</span> white napery spread in quiet homes<span class="s2">;</span> all that is slowly shaped toward eternity. The village streamed past beneath his wings<span class="s2">,</span> yield­ing the secrets of closed gardens that their walls no longer guarded. He landed<span class="s2">;</span> and now he knew that he had seen nothing at all<span class="s2">,</span> only a few men slowly moving amongst their stones. The village kept<span class="s2">,</span> by its mere immo­bility<span class="s2">,</span> the secret of its passions and withheld its kindly charm<span class="s2">;</span> for<span class="s2">,</span> to master that<span class="s2">,</span> he would have needed to give up an active life.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>The ten minutes' halt was ended and Fabien resumed his flight. He glanced back toward San Julian<span class="s2">;</span> all he now could see was a cluster of lights<span class="s2">,</span> then stars<span class="s2">,</span> then twinkling star-dust that vanished<span class="s2">,</span> tempting him for the last time.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span><span class="s2">“</span>I can't see the dials<span class="s2">;</span> I'll light up."</p>
<p class="p3">He touched the switches<span class="s2">,</span> but the red light falling from the cockpit lamps upon the dial-hands was so diluted with the blue evening glow that they did not catch its color. When he passed his fingers before a bulb<span class="s2">,</span> they were hardly tinged at all.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>"Too soon."</p>
<p class="p3">But night was rising like a tawny smoke and already the valleys were brimming over with it. No longer were they distinguishable from the plains. The villages were lighting up<span class="s2">,</span> constellations that greeted each other across the dusk. And<span class="s2">,</span> at a touch of his finger<span class="s2">,</span> his flying-lights flashed back a greeting to them. The earth grew spangled with light-signals as each house lit its star<span class="s2">,</span> searching the vastness of the night as a lighthouse sweeps the sea. Now every place that sheltered human life was sparkling. And it rejoiced him to enter into this one night with a measured slowness<span class="s2">,</span> as into an anchorage.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>He bent down into the cockpit<span class="s2">;</span> the lumi­nous dial-hands were beginning to show up. The pilot read their figures one by one<span class="s2">;</span> all was going well. He felt at ease up here<span class="s2">,</span> snugly ensconced. He passed his fingers along a steel rib and felt the stream of life that flowed in it<span class="s2">;</span> the metal did not vibrate<span class="s2">,</span> yet it was alive. The engine's five-hundred horse-power bred in its texture a very gentle current<span class="s2">,</span> fraying its ice-cold rind into a velvety bloom. Once again the pilot in full flight experienced neither giddiness nor any thrill<span class="s2">;</span> only the mys­tery of metal turned to living flesh.</p>
<p class="p3">So he had found his world again. . . . A few digs of his elbow<span class="s2">,</span> and he was quite at home. He tapped the dashboard<span class="s2">,</span> touched the contacts one by one<span class="s2">,</span> shifting his limbs a little<span class="s2">,</span> and<span class="s2">,</span> settling himself more solidly<span class="s2">,</span> felt for the best position whence to gage the faintest lurch of his five tons of metal<span class="s2">,</span> jostled by the heaving darkness. Groping with his fingers<span class="s2">,</span> he plug­ged in his emergency-lamp<span class="s2">,</span> let go of it<span class="s2">,</span> felt for it again<span class="s2">,</span> made sure it held<span class="s2">;</span> then lightly touched each switch<span class="s2">,</span> to be certain of finding it later<span class="s2">,</span> training his hands to function in a blind man's world. Now that his hands had learnt their role by heart<span class="s2">,</span> he ventured to turn on a lamp<span class="s2">,</span> making the cockpit bright with polished fittings and then<span class="s2">,</span> as on a submarine about to dive<span class="s2">,</span> watched his passage into night upon the dials only. Nothing shook or rattled<span class="s2">,</span> neither gyroscope nor altimeter flickered in the least<span class="s2">,</span> the engine was running smoothly<span class="s2">;</span> so now he relaxed his limbs a little<span class="s2">,</span> let his neck sink back into the leather padding and fell into the deeply meditative mood of flight<span class="s2">,</span> mellow with inexplicable hopes.</p>
<p class="p3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span>Now<span class="s2">,</span> a watchman from the heart of night<span class="s2">,</span> he learnt how night betrays man's presence<span class="s2">,</span> his voices<span class="s2">,</span> lights<span class="s2">,</span> and his unrest. That star down there in the shadows<span class="s2">,</span> alone<span class="s2">;</span> a lonely house. Yonder a fading star<span class="s2">;</span> that house is closing in upon its love. . . . Or on its lassi­tude. A house that has ceased to flash its signal to the world. Gathered round their lamp-lit table<span class="s2">,</span> those peasants do not know the measure of their hopes<span class="s2">;</span> they do not guess that their desire carries so far<span class="s2">,</span> out into the vastness of the night that hems them in. But Fabien has met it on his path<span class="s2">,</span> when<span class="s2">,</span> coming from a thousand miles away<span class="s2">,</span> he feels the heavy ground-swell raise his panting plane and let it sink<span class="s2">,</span> when he has crossed a dozen storms like lands at war<span class="s2">,</span> between them neutral tracts of moonlight<span class="s2">,</span> to reach at last those lights<span class="s2">,</span> one following the other — and knows himself a conqueror. They think<span class="s2">,</span> these peasants<span class="s2">,</span> that their lamp shines only for that little table<span class="s2">;</span> but<span class="s2">,</span> from fifty miles away<span class="s2">,</span> some one has felt the summons of their light<span class="s2">,</span> as though it were a desperate signal from some lonely island<span class="s2">,</span> flashed by shipwrecked men toward the sea.</p>
<p class="p3">chapter two</p>
<p class="p3">Thus the Three Planes of the Air-Mail Service —</p>
<p class="p3">Thus the three planes of the air-mail service<span class="s2">,</span> from Patagonia<span class="s2">,</span> Chile<span class="s2">,</span> and Paraguay<span class="s2">,</span> were converging from south<span class="s2">,</span> west<span class="s2">,</span> and north on Buenos Aires. Their arrival with the mails would give the signal for the departure<span class="s2">,</span> about midnight<span class="s2">,</span> of the Europe postal plane.</p>
<p class="p3">Three pilots<span class="s2">,</span> each behind a cowling heavy as a river-barge<span class="s2">,</span> intent upon his flight<span class="s2">,</span> were hastening through the distant darkness<span class="s2">,</span> soon to come slowly down<span class="s2">,</span> from a sky of storm or calm<span class="s2">,</span> like wild<span class="s2">,</span> outlandish peasants descend­ing from their highlands.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> who was responsible for the entire service<span class="s2">,</span> was pacing to and fro on the Buenos Aires landing-ground. He was in silent mood<span class="s2">,</span> for<span class="s2">,</span> till the three planes had come in<span class="s2">,</span> he could not shake off a feeling of apprehension which had been haunting him all day. Minute by minute<span class="s2">,</span> as the telegrams were passed to him<span class="s2">,</span> Rivière felt that he had scored another point against fate<span class="s2">,</span> reduced the quantum of the unknown<span class="s2">,</span> and was drawing his charges in<span class="s2">,</span> out of the clutches of the night<span class="s2">,</span> toward their haven.</p>
<p class="p3">One of the hands came up to Rivière with a radio message.</p>
<p class="p3">"Chile mail reports: Buenos Aires in sight." "Good."</p>
<p class="p3">Presently<span class="s2">,</span> then<span class="s2">,</span> Rivière would hear its drone<span class="s2">;</span> already the night was yielding up one of them<span class="s2">,</span> as a sea<span class="s2">,</span> heavy with its secrets and the cadence of the tides<span class="s2">,</span> surrenders to the shore a treasure long the plaything of the waves. And soon the night would give him back the other two.</p>
<p class="p3">Then to-day's work would be over. Worn out<span class="s2">,</span> the crews would go to sleep<span class="s2">,</span> fresh crews replace them. Rivière alone would have no respite<span class="s2">;</span> then<span class="s2">,</span> in its turn<span class="s2">,</span> the Europe mail would weigh upon his mind. And so it would always be. Always. For the first time in his life this veteran fighter caught himself feeling tired. Never could an arrival of the planes mean for him the victory that ends a war and preludes a spell of smiling peace. For him it meant just one more step<span class="s2">,</span> with a thousand more to follow<span class="s2">,</span> along a straight<span class="s2">,</span> unending road. Rivière felt as though for an eternity he had been carrying a crushing load on his up­lifted arms<span class="s2">;</span> an endless<span class="s2">,</span> hopeless effort.</p>
<p class="p3">"I'm aging." If he no longer found a solace in work and work alone<span class="s2">,</span> surely he was grow­ing old. He caught himself puzzling over problems which hitherto he had ignored. There surged within his mind<span class="s2">,</span> like a lost ocean<span class="s2">,</span> murmuring regrets<span class="s2">,</span> all the gentler joys of life that he had thrust aside. "Can it be coming on me — so soon<span class="s2">?</span>" He realized that he had always been postponing for his de­clining years<span class="s2">,</span> "when I have time for it<span class="s2">,</span>" every­thing that makes life kind to men. As if it were ever possible to "have time for it" one day and realize at life's end that dream of peace and happiness! No<span class="s2">,</span> peace there could be none<span class="s2">;</span> nor any victory<span class="s2">,</span> perhaps. Never could all the air-mails land in one swoop once for all.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière paused before Leroux<span class="s2">;</span> the old foreman was hard at work. Leroux<span class="s2">,</span> too<span class="s2">,</span> had forty years of work behind him. All his energies were for his work. When at ten o'clock or midnight Leroux went home it certainly was not to find a change of scene<span class="s2">,</span> escape into another world. When Rivière smiled toward him<span class="s2">,</span> he raised his heavy head and pointed at a burnt-out axle. "Jammed it was<span class="s2">,</span> but I've fixed it up." Rivière bent down to look<span class="s2">;</span> duty had regained its hold upon him. "You should tell the shop to set them a bit looser." He passed his finger over the trace of seizing<span class="s2">,</span> then glanced again at Leroux. As his eyes lingered on the stern old wrinkled face<span class="s2">,</span> an odd question hovered on his lips and made him smile.</p>
<p class="p3">"Ever had much to do with love<span class="s2">,</span> Leroux<span class="s2">,</span> in your time<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"Love<span class="s2">,</span> sir<span class="s2">?</span> Well<span class="s2">,</span> you see —"</p>
<p class="p3">"Hadn't the time for it<span class="s2">,</span> I suppose — like me.</p>
<p class="p3">"Not a great deal<span class="s2">,</span> sir."</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière strained his ears to hear if there were any bitterness in the reply<span class="s2">;</span> no<span class="s2">,</span> not a trace of it. This man<span class="s2">,</span> looking back on life<span class="s2">,</span> felt the quiet satisfaction of a carpenter who has made a good job of planing down a board: "There you are! That's done."</p>
<p class="p3">"There you are<span class="s2">,</span>" thought Rivière. "My life's done."</p>
<p class="p3">Then<span class="s2">,</span> brushing aside the swarm of somber thoughts his weariness had brought<span class="s2">,</span> he walked toward the hangar<span class="s2">;</span> for the Chile plane was droning down toward it.</p>
<p class="p3">chapter three</p>
<p class="p3">The Sound of the Distant Engine Swelled and Thickened —</p>
<p class="p3">The sound of the distant engine swelled and thickened<span class="s2">;</span> a sound of ripening. Lights flashed out. The red lamps on the light-tower sil­houetted a hangar<span class="s2">,</span> radio standards<span class="s2">,</span> a square landing-ground. The setting of a gala night.</p>
<p class="p3">"There she comes!"</p>
<p class="p3">A sheaf of beams had caught the grounding plane<span class="s2">,</span> making it shine as if brand-new. No sooner had it come to rest before the hangar than mechanics and airdrome hands hurried up to unload the mail. Only Pellerin<span class="s2">,</span> the pilot<span class="s2">,</span> did not move.</p>
<p class="p3">"Well<span class="s2">,</span> aren't you going to get down<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">The pilot<span class="s2">,</span> intent on some mysterious task<span class="s2">,</span> did not deign to reply. Listening<span class="s2">,</span> perhaps<span class="s2">,</span> to sounds that he alone could hear<span class="s2">,</span> long echoes of the flight. Nodding reflectively<span class="s2">,</span> he bent down and tinkered with some unseen object. At last he turned toward the officials and his comrades<span class="s2">,</span> gravely taking stock of them as though of his possessions. He seemed to pass them in review<span class="s2">,</span> to weigh them<span class="s2">,</span> take their measure<span class="s2">,</span> saying to himself that he had earned his right to them<span class="s2">,</span> as to this hangar with its gala lights and solid concrete and<span class="s2">,</span> in the offing<span class="s2">,</span> the city<span class="s2">,</span> full of movement<span class="s2">,</span> warmth<span class="s2">,</span> and women. In the hollow of his large hands he seemed to hold this folk<span class="s2">;</span> they were his subjects<span class="s2">,</span> to touch or hear or curse<span class="s2">,</span> as the fancy took him. His impulse now was to curse them for a lazy crowd<span class="s2">,</span> so sure of life they seemed<span class="s2">,</span> gaping at the moon<span class="s2">;</span> but he decided to be genial instead.</p>
<p class="p3">". . . Drinks are on you!"</p>
<p class="p3">Then he climbed down.</p>
<p class="p3">He wanted to tell them about the trip. "If only you knew . . . !"</p>
<p class="p3">Evidently<span class="s2">,</span> to his thinking<span class="s2">,</span> that summed it up<span class="s2">,</span> for now he walked off to change his flying gear.</p>
<p class="p3">As the car was taking him to Buenos Aires in the company of a morose inspector and Rivière in silent mood<span class="s2">,</span> Pellerin suddenly felt sad<span class="s2">;</span> of course<span class="s2">,</span> he thought<span class="s2">,</span> it's a fine thing for a fellow to have gone through it and<span class="s2">,</span> when he's got his footing again<span class="s2">,</span> let off a healthy volley of curses. Nothing finer in the world! But afterwards . . . when you look back on it all<span class="s2">;</span> you wonder<span class="s2">,</span> you aren't half so sure!</p>
<p class="p3">A struggle with a cyclone<span class="s2">,</span> that at least is a straight fight<span class="s2">,</span> it's real. But not that curious look things wear<span class="s2">,</span> the face they have when they think they are alone. His thoughts took form. "Like a revolution it is<span class="s2">;</span> men's faces turning only the least shade paler<span class="s2">,</span> yet utterly unlike themselves."</p>
<p class="p3">He bent his mind toward the memory.</p>
<p class="p3">He had been crossing peacefully the Cor­dillera of the Andes. A snow-bound stillness brooded on the ranges<span class="s2">;</span> the winter snow had brought its peace to all this vastness<span class="s2">,</span> as in dead castles the passing centuries spread peace. Two hundred miles without a man<span class="s2">,</span> a breath of life<span class="s2">,</span> a movement<span class="s2">;</span> only sheer peaks that<span class="s2">,</span> flying at twenty thousand feet<span class="s2">,</span> you almost graze<span class="s2">,</span> straight-falling cloaks of stone<span class="s2">,</span> an ominous tranquillity.</p>
<p class="p3">It had happened somewhere near the Tupungato Peak. . . .</p>
<p class="p3">He reflected. . . . Yes<span class="s2">,</span> it was there he saw a miracle take place.</p>
<p class="p3">For at first he had noticed nothing much<span class="s2">,</span> felt no more than a vague uneasiness—as when a man believes himself alone<span class="s2">,</span> but is not<span class="s2">;</span> some one is watching him. Too late<span class="s2">,</span> and how he could not comprehend<span class="s2">,</span> he realized that he was hemmed in by anger. Where was it coming from<span class="s2">,</span> this anger<span class="s2">?</span> What told him it was oozing from the stones<span class="s2">,</span> sweating from the snow<span class="s2">?</span> For nothing seemed on its way to him<span class="s2">,</span> no storm was lowering. And still—another world<span class="s2">,</span> like it and yet unlike<span class="s2">,</span> was issuing from the world around him. Now all those quiet-looking peaks<span class="s2">,</span> snow-caps<span class="s2">,</span> and ridges<span class="s2">,</span> growing faintly grayer<span class="s2">,</span> seemed to spring to life<span class="s2">,</span> a people of the snows. And an inex­plicable anguish gripped his heart.</p>
<p class="p3">Instinctively he tightened his grasp on the controls. Something he did not understand was on its way and he tautened his muscles<span class="s2">,</span> like a beast about to spring. Yet<span class="s2">,</span> as far as eye could see<span class="s2">,</span> all was at peace. Peaceful<span class="s2">,</span> yes<span class="s2">,</span> but tense with some dark potency.</p>
<p class="p3">Suddenly all grew sharp<span class="s2">;</span> peaks and ridges seemed keen-edged prows cutting athwart a heavy head wind. Veering around him<span class="s2">,</span> they deployed like dreadnoughts taking their posi­tions in a battle-line. Dusk began to mingle with the air<span class="s2">,</span> rising and hovering<span class="s2">,</span> a veil above the snow. Looking back to see if retreat might still be feasible<span class="s2">,</span> he shuddered<span class="s2">;</span> all the Cordillera behind him was in seething ferment.</p>
<p class="p3">"I'm lost!"</p>
<p class="p3">On a peak ahead of him the snow swirled up into the air — a snow volcano. Upon his right flared up another peak and<span class="s2">,</span> one by one<span class="s2">,</span> all the summits grew lambent with gray fire<span class="s2">,</span> as if some unseen messenger had touched them into flame. Then the first squall broke and all the mountains round the pilot quiv­ered.</p>
<p class="p3">Violent action leaves little trace behind it and he had no recollection of the gusts that buffeted him then from side to side. Only one clear memory remained<span class="s2">;</span> the battle in a welter of gray flames.</p>
<p class="p3">He pondered.</p>
<p class="p3">"A cyclone<span class="s2">,</span> that's nothing. A man just saves his skin! It's what comes before it — the thing one meets upon the way!"</p>
<p class="p3">But already even as he thought he had re­called it<span class="s2">,</span> that one face in a thousand<span class="s2">,</span> he had forgotten what it was like.</p>

<p class="p3">Rivière Glanced at the Pilot.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière glanced at the pilot. In twenty min­utes Pellerin would step from the car<span class="s2">,</span> mingle the crowd<span class="s2">,</span> and know the burden of his lassitude. Perhaps he would murmur: "Tired out as usual. It's a dog's life!" To his wife he would<span class="s2">,</span> perhaps<span class="s2">,</span> let fall a word or two: "A fellow's better off here than flying above the Andes!" And yet that world to which men hold so strongly had almost slipped from him<span class="s2">;</span> he had come to know its wretchedness. He had returned from a few hours' life on the other side of the picture<span class="s2">,</span> ignoring if it would be possible for him ever to retrieve this city with its lights<span class="s2">,</span> ever to know again his little human frailties<span class="s2">,</span> irksome yet cherished child­hood friends.</p>
<p class="p3">"In every crowd<span class="s2">,</span>" Rivière mused<span class="s2">,</span> "are cer­tain persons who seem just like the rest<span class="s2">,</span> yet they bear amazing messages. Unwittingly<span class="s2">,</span> no doubt<span class="s2">,</span> unless—" Rivière was chary of a certain type of admirers<span class="s2">,</span> blind to the higher side of this adventure<span class="s2">,</span> whose vain applause per­verted its meaning<span class="s2">,</span> debased its human dig­nity. But Pellerin's inalienable greatness lay in this — his simple yet sure awareness of what the world<span class="s2">,</span> seen from a special angle<span class="s2">,</span> signified<span class="s2">,</span> his massive scorn of vulgar flattery. So Rivière congratulated him: "Well<span class="s2">,</span> how did you bring it off<span class="s2">?</span>" And loved him for his knack of only "talking shop<span class="s2">,</span>" referring to his flight as a blacksmith to his anvil.</p>
<p class="p3">Pellerin began by telling how his retreat had been cut off. It was almost as if he were apologizing about it. "There was nothing else for it!" Then he had lost sight of everything<span class="s2">,</span> blinded by the snow. He owed his escape to the violent air-currents which had driven him up to twenty-five thousand feet. "I guess they held me all the way just above the level of the peaks." He mentioned his trouble with the gyroscope and how he had had to shift the air-inlet<span class="s2">,</span> as the snow was clogging it<span class="s2">;</span> "form­ing a frost-glaze<span class="s2">,</span> you see." After that another set of air-currents had driven Pellerin down and<span class="s2">,</span> when he was only at ten thousand feet or so<span class="s2">,</span> he was puzzled why he had not run in­to anything. As a matter of fact he was al­ready above the plains. "I spotted it all of a sudden when I came out into a clear patch." And he explained how it had felt at that moment<span class="s2">;</span> just as if he had escaped from a cave.</p>
<p class="p3">"Storm at Mendoza<span class="s2">,</span> too<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"No. The sky was clear when I made my landing<span class="s2">,</span> not a breath of wind. But the storm was at my heels all right!"</p>
<p class="p3">It was such a damned queer business<span class="s2">,</span> he said<span class="s2">;</span> that was why he mentioned it. The sum­mits were lost in snow at a great height while the lower slopes seemed to be streaming out across the plain<span class="s2">,</span> like a flood of black lava which swallowed up the villages one by one. "Never saw anything like it before. . . ." Then he relapsed into silence<span class="s2">,</span> gripped by some secret memory.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière turned to the inspector.</p>
<p class="p3">"That's a Pacific cyclone<span class="s2">;</span> it's too late to take any action now. Anyhow these cyclones never cross the Andes."</p>
<p class="p3">No one could have foreseen that this par­ticular cyclone would continue its advance toward the east.</p>
<p class="p3">The inspector<span class="s2">,</span> who had no ideas on the subject<span class="s2">,</span> assented.</p>
<p class="p3">The inspector seemed about to speak. Then he hesitated<span class="s2">,</span> turned toward Pellerin<span class="s2">,</span> and his Adam's apple stirred. But he held his peace and<span class="s2">,</span> after a moment's thought<span class="s2">,</span> resumed his air of melancholy dignity<span class="s2">,</span> looking straight before him.</p>
<p class="p3">That melancholy of his<span class="s2">,</span> he carried it about with him everywhere<span class="s2">,</span> like a handbag. No sooner had he landed in Argentina than Rivière had appointed him to certain vague func­tions<span class="s2">,</span> and now his large hands and inspec­torial dignity got always in his way. He had no right to admire imagination or ready wit<span class="s2">;</span> it was his business to commend punctuality and punctuality alone. He had no right to take a glass of wine in company<span class="s2">,</span> to call a comrade by his Christian name or risk a joke<span class="s2">;</span> unless<span class="s2">,</span> of course<span class="s2">,</span> by some rare chance<span class="s2">,</span> he came across another inspector on the same run.</p>
<p class="p3">"It's hard luck<span class="s2">,</span>" he thought<span class="s2">,</span> "always hav­ing to be a judge."</p>
<p class="p3">As a matter of fact he never judged<span class="s2">;</span> he merely wagged his head. To mask his utter ignorance he would slowly<span class="s2">,</span> thoughtfully<span class="s2">,</span> wag his head at everything that came his way<span class="s2">,</span> a movement that struck fear into uneasy con­sciences and ensured the proper upkeep of the plant.</p>
<p class="p3">He was not beloved — but then inspectors are not made for love and such delights<span class="s2">,</span> only for drawing up reports. He had desisted from proposing changes of system or technical im­provements since Rivière had written: <span class="s2">“</span>In­spector Robineau is requested to supply re­ports<span class="s2">,</span> not poems. He will be putting his talents to better use by speeding up the per­sonnel.<span class="s2">”</span> From that day forth Inspector Ro­bineau had battened on human frailties<span class="s2">,</span> as on his daily bread<span class="s2">;</span> on the mechanic who had a glass too much<span class="s2">,</span> the airport overseer who stayed up of nights<span class="s2">,</span> the pilot who bumped a landing.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière said of him: "He is far from in­telligent<span class="s2">,</span> but very useful to us<span class="s2">,</span> such as he is." One of the rules which Rivière rigor­ously imposed — upon himself — was a knowl­edge of his men. For Robineau the only knowledge that counted was knowledge of the orders.</p>
<p class="p3">"Robineau<span class="s2">,</span>" Rivière had said one day<span class="s2">,</span> "you must cut the punctuality bonus when­ever a plane starts late."</p>
<p class="p3">"Even when it's nobody's fault<span class="s2">?</span> In case of fog<span class="s2">,</span> for instance<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"Even in case of fog."</p>
<p class="p3">Robineau felt a thrill of pride in knowing that his chief was strong enough not to shrink from being unjust. Surely Robineau himself would win reflected majesty from such over­weening power!</p>
<p class="p3">"You postponed the start till six fifteen<span class="s2">,</span>" he would say to the airport superintendents. "We cannot allow your bonus."</p>
<p class="p3">"But<span class="s2">,</span> Monsieur Robineau<span class="s2">,</span> at five thirty one couldn't see ten yards ahead!"</p>
<p class="p3">"Those are the orders."</p>
<p class="p3">"But<span class="s2">,</span> Monsieur Robineau<span class="s2">,</span> we couldn't sweep the fog away with a broom!"</p>
<p class="p3">He alone amongst all these nonentities knew the secret<span class="s2">;</span> if you only punish men enough<span class="s2">,</span> the weather will improve!</p>
<p class="p3">"He never thinks at all<span class="s2">,</span>" said Rivière of him<span class="s2">,</span> "and that prevents him from thinking wrong."</p>
<p class="p3">The pilot who damaged a plane lost his no-accident bonus.</p>
<p class="p3">"But supposing his engine gives out when he is over a wood<span class="s2">?</span>" Robineau inquired of his chief.</p>
<p class="p3">"Even when it occurs above a wood."</p>
<p class="p3">Robineau took to heart the ipse dixit.</p>
<p class="p3">"I regret<span class="s2">,</span>" he would inform the pilots with cheerful zest<span class="s2">,</span> "I regret it very much indeed<span class="s2">,</span> but you should have had your breakdown somewhere else."</p>
<p class="p3">"But<span class="s2">,</span> Monsieur Robineau<span class="s2">,</span> one doesn't choose the place to have it."</p>
<p class="p3">"Those are the orders."</p>
<p class="p3">The orders<span class="s2">,</span> thought Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> are like the rites of a religion<span class="s2">;</span> they may look absurd but they shape men in their mold. It was no con­cern to Rivière whether he seemed just or un­just. Perhaps the words were meaningless to him. The little townsfolk of the little towns promenade each evening round a bandstand and Rivière thought: It's nonsense to talk of being just or unjust toward them<span class="s2">;</span> they don't exist.</p>
<p class="p3">For him<span class="s2">,</span> a man was a mere lump of wax to be kneaded into shape. It was his task to. fur­nish this dead matter with a soul<span class="s2">,</span> to inject will-power into it. Not that he wished to make slaves of his men<span class="s2">;</span> his aim was to raise them above themselves. In punishing them for each delay he acted<span class="s2">,</span> no doubt<span class="s2">,</span> unjustly<span class="s2">,</span> but he bent the will of every crew to punctual departure<span class="s2">;</span> or<span class="s2">,</span> rather<span class="s2">,</span> he bred in them the will to keep to time. Denying his men the right to welcome foggy weather as the pretext for a leisure hour<span class="s2">,</span> he kept them so breathlessly eager for the fog to lift that even the hum­blest mechanic felt a twinge of shame for the delay. Thus they were quick to profit by the least rift in the armor of the skies.</p>
<p class="p3">"An opening on the north<span class="s2">;</span> let's be off!"</p>
<p class="p3">Thanks to Rivière the service of the mails was paramount over twenty thousand miles of land and sea.</p>
<p class="p3">"The men are happy<span class="s2">,</span>" he would say<span class="s2">,</span> "be­cause they like their work<span class="s2">,</span> and they like it because I am hard."</p>
<p class="p3">And hard he may have been — still he gave his men keen pleasure for all that. "They need<span class="s2">,</span>" he would say to himself<span class="s2">,</span> "to be urged on toward a hardy life<span class="s2">,</span> with its sufferings and its joys<span class="s2">;</span> only that matters."</p>
<p class="p3">As the car approached the city<span class="s2">,</span> Rivière in­structed the driver to take him to the Head Office. Presently Robineau found himself alone with Pellerin and a question shaped itself upon his lips.</p>
<p class="p3">chapter five</p>
<p class="p3">Robineau Was Feeling Tired Tonight.</p>
<p class="p3">Robineau was feeling tired tonight. Look­ing at Pellerin — Pellerin the Conqueror — he had just discovered that his own life was a gray one. Worst of all<span class="s2">,</span> he was coming to real­ize that<span class="s2">,</span> for all his rank of inspector and au­thority<span class="s2">,</span> he<span class="s2">,</span> Robineau<span class="s2">,</span> cut a poor figure beside this travel-stained and weary pilot<span class="s2">,</span> crouching in a corner of the car<span class="s2">,</span> his eyes closed and hands all grimed with oil. For the first time<span class="s2">,</span> Robineau was learning to admire. A need to speak of this came over him and<span class="s2">,</span> above all<span class="s2">,</span> to make a friend.</p>
<p class="p3">He was tired of his journey and the day's rebuffs and felt perhaps a little ridiculous. That very evening<span class="s2">,</span> when verifying the gaso­line reserve<span class="s2">,</span> he had botched his figures and the agent<span class="s2">,</span> whom he had wanted to catch out<span class="s2">,</span> had taken compassion and totted them up for him. What was worse<span class="s2">,</span> he had commented on the fitting of a Model B.6 oil-pump<span class="s2">,</span> mistaking it for the B.4 type<span class="s2">,</span> and the mechanics with ironic smiles had let him maunder on for twenty minutes about this "inexcusable stupidity" — his own stupidity.</p>
<p class="p3">He dreaded his room at the hotel. From Toulouse to Buenos Aires<span class="s2">,</span> straight to his room he always went once the day's work was over. Safely ensconced and darkly conscious of the secrets he carried in his breast<span class="s2">,</span> he would draw from his bag a sheet of paper and slowly inscribe <span class="s2">“</span>Report<span class="s2">”</span> on it<span class="s2">,</span> write a line or two at random<span class="s2">,</span> then tear it up. He would have liked to save the company from some tremendous peril<span class="s2">;</span> but it was not in any dan­ger. All he had saved so far was a slightly rusted propeller-boss. He had slowly passed his finger over the rust with a mournful air<span class="s2">,</span> eyed by an airport overseer<span class="s2">,</span> whose only com­ment was: "Better call up the last halt<span class="s2">;</span> this plane's only just in." Robineau was losing confidence in himself.</p>
<p class="p3">At a venture he essayed a friendly move. "Would you care to dine with me<span class="s2">?</span>" he asked Pellerin. "I'd enjoy a quiet chat<span class="s2">;</span> my job's pretty exhausting at times."</p>
<p class="p3">Then<span class="s2">,</span> reluctant to quit his pedestal too soon<span class="s2">,</span> he added: "The responsibility<span class="s2">,</span> you know."</p>
<p class="p3">His subordinates did not much relish the idea of intimacy with Robineau<span class="s2">;</span> it had its dangers. "If he's not dug up something for his report<span class="s2">,</span> with an appetite like his<span class="s2">,</span> I guess he'll just eat me up!"</p>
<p class="p3">But Robineau's mind this evening was full of his personal afflictions. He suffered from an annoying eczema<span class="s2">,</span> his only real secret<span class="s2">;</span> he would have liked to talk about his trouble<span class="s2">,</span> to be pitied and<span class="s2">,</span> now that pride had played him false<span class="s2">,</span> find solace in humility. Then again there was his mistress over there in France<span class="s2">,</span> who had to hear the nightly tale of his in­spections whenever he returned. He hoped to impress her thus and earn her love but — his usual lucid — he only seemed to aggravate her. He wanted to talk about her<span class="s2">,</span> too.</p>
<p class="p3">"So you'll come to dinner<span class="s2">?</span>" Good-naturedly Pellerin assented.</p>
<p class="p3">chapter six</p>
<p class="p3">The Clerks Were Drowsing in the Buenos Aires Office —</p>
<p class="p3">The clerks were drowsing in the Buenos Aires office when Rivière entered. He had kept his overcoat and hat on<span class="s2">,</span> like the inces­sant traveler he always seemed to be. His spare person took up so little room<span class="s2">,</span> his clothes and graying hair so aptly fitted into any scene<span class="s2">,</span> that when he went by hardly any one noticed it. Yet<span class="s2">,</span> at his entry<span class="s2">,</span> a wave of energy tra­versed the office. The staff bustled<span class="s2">,</span> the head clerk hurriedly compiled the papers remain­ing on his desk<span class="s2">,</span> typewriters began to click.</p>
<p class="p3">The telephonist was busily slipping his plugs into the standard and noting the tele­grams in a bulky register<span class="s2">,</span> Rivière sat down and read them.</p>
<p class="p3">All that he read<span class="s2">,</span> the Chile episode ex­cepted<span class="s2">,</span> told of one of those favored days when things go right of themselves and each suc­cessive message from the airports is another bulletin of victory. The Patagonia mail<span class="s2">,</span> too<span class="s2">,</span> was making headway<span class="s2">;</span> all the planes were ahead of time<span class="s2">,</span> for fair winds were bearing them northward on a favoring tide.</p>
<p class="p3">"Give me the weather reports."</p>
<p class="p3">Each airport vaunted its fine weather<span class="s2">,</span> clear sky<span class="s2">,</span> and clement breeze. The mantle of a golden evening had fallen on South America. And Rivière welcomed this friendliness of things. True<span class="s2">,</span> one of the planes was battling somewhere with the perils of the night<span class="s2">,</span> but the odds were in its favor.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière pushed the book aside.</p>
<p class="p3">"That will do."</p>
<p class="p3">Then<span class="s2">,</span> a night-warden whose charge was half the world<span class="s2">,</span> he went out to inspect the men on night duty<span class="s2">,</span> and came back.</p>
<p class="p3">Later<span class="s2">,</span> standing at an open window<span class="s2">,</span> he took the measure of the darkness. It contained Buenos Aires yonder<span class="s2">,</span> but also like the hull of some huge ship<span class="s2">,</span> America. He did not won­der at this feeling of immensity<span class="s2">;</span> the sky of Santiago de Chile might be a foreign sky<span class="s2">,</span> but once the air-mail was in flight toward Santi­ago you lived<span class="s2">,</span> from end to journey's end<span class="s2">,</span> under the same dark vault of heaven. Even now the Patagonian fishermen were gazing at the navigation lights of the plane whose messages were being awaited here. The vague unrest of an aeroplane in flight brooded not only on Rivière's heart but<span class="s2">,</span> with the droning of the engine<span class="s2">,</span> upon the capitals and little towns.</p>
<p class="p3">Glad of this night that promised so well<span class="s2">,</span> he recalled those other nights of chaos<span class="s2">,</span> when a plane had seemed hemmed in with dangers<span class="s2">,</span> its rescue well-nigh a forlorn hope<span class="s2">,</span> and how to the Buenos Aires Radio Post its desperate calls came faltering through<span class="s2">,</span> fused with the atmospherics of the storm. Under the leaden weight of sky the golden music of the waves was tarnished. Lament in the minor of a plane sped arrow wise against the blinding barriers of darkness<span class="s2">,</span> no sadder sound than this!</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière remembered that the place of an inspector<span class="s2">,</span> when the staff is on night duty<span class="s2">,</span> is in the office.</p>
<p class="p3">"Send for Monsieur Robineau."</p>
<p class="p3">Robineau had all but made a friend of his guest<span class="s2">,</span> the pilot. Under his eyes he had un­packed his suitcase and revealed those trivial objects which link inspectors with the rest of men<span class="s2">;</span> some shirts in execrable taste<span class="s2">,</span> a dress­ing-set<span class="s2">,</span> the photograph of a lean woman<span class="s2">,</span> which the inspector pinned to the wall. Hum­bly thus he imparted to Pellerin his needs<span class="s2">,</span> affections<span class="s2">,</span> and regrets. Laying before the pi­lot's eyes his sorry treasures<span class="s2">,</span> he laid bare all his wretchedness. A moral eczema. His prison.</p>
<p class="p3">But a speck of light remained for Robi­neau<span class="s2">,</span> as for every man<span class="s2">,</span> and it was in a mood of quiet ecstasy that he drew<span class="s2">,</span> from the bottom of his valise<span class="s2">,</span> a little bag carefully wrapped up in paper. He fumbled with it some mo­ments without speaking. Then he unclasped his hands.</p>
<p class="p3">"I brought this from the Sahara."</p>
<p class="p3">The inspector blushed to think that he had thus betrayed himself. For all his chagrins<span class="s2">,</span> domestic misadventures<span class="s2">,</span> for all the gray re­ality of life he had a solace<span class="s2">,</span> these little black­ish pebbles—talismans to open doors of mys­tery.</p>
<p class="p3">His blush grew a little deeper. "You find exactly the same kind in Brazil."</p>
<p class="p3">Then Pellerin had slapped the shoulder of an inspector poring upon Atlantis and<span class="s2">,</span> as in duty bound<span class="s2">,</span> had asked a question.</p>
<p class="p3">"Keen on geology<span class="s2">,</span> eh<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"Keen<span class="s2">?</span> I'm mad about it!"</p>
<p class="p3">All his life long only the stones had not been hard on him.</p>
<p class="p3">Hearing that he was wanted<span class="s2">,</span> Robineau felt sad but forthwith resumed his air of dig­nity.</p>
<p class="p3">"I must leave you. Monsieur Rivière needs my assistance for certain important prob­lems."</p>
<p class="p3">When Robineau entered the office<span class="s2">,</span> Rivière had forgotten all about him. He was musing before a wall-map on which the company's air-lines were traced in red. The inspector awaited his chief's orders. Long minutes passed before Rivière addressed him<span class="s2">,</span> without turning his head.</p>
<p class="p3">"What is your idea of this map<span class="s2">,</span> Robineau<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">He had a way of springing conundrums of this sort when he came out of a brown study.</p>
<p class="p3">"The map<span class="s2">,</span> Monsieur Rivière<span class="s2">?</span> Well—"</p>
<p class="p3">As a matter of fact he had no ideas on the subject<span class="s2">;</span> nevertheless frowning at the map<span class="s2">,</span> he roved all Europe and America with an in­spectorial eye. Meanwhile Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> in silence<span class="s2">,</span> pursued his train of thought. "On the face of it<span class="s2">,</span> a pretty scheme enough—but it's ruth­less. When one thinks of all the lives<span class="s2">,</span> young fellows' lives<span class="s2">,</span> it has cost usl It's a fine<span class="s2">,</span> solid thing and we must bow to its authority<span class="s2">,</span> of course<span class="s2">;</span> but what a host of problems it pre­sents!" With Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> however<span class="s2">,</span> nothing mat­tered save the end in view.</p>
<p class="p3">Robineau<span class="s2">,</span> standing beside him with his eyes fixed on the map<span class="s2">,</span> was gradually pulling himself together. Pity from Rivière was not to be expected<span class="s2">;</span> that he knew. Once he had chanced it<span class="s2">,</span> explaining how that grotesque infirmity of his had spoilt his life. All he had got from Rivière was a jeer. "Stops you sleeping<span class="s2">,</span> eh<span class="s2">?</span> So much the better for your work!"</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière spoke only half in jest. One of his sayings was: "If a composer suffers from loss of sleep and his sleeplessness induces him to turn out masterpieces<span class="s2">,</span> what a profitable loss it is!" One day<span class="s2">,</span> too<span class="s2">,</span> he had said of Leroux: "Just look at him! I call it a fine thing<span class="s2">,</span> ugli­ness like that—so perfect that it would warn off any sweetheart!" And perhaps<span class="s2">,</span> indeed<span class="s2">,</span> Leroux owed what was finest in him to his misfortune<span class="s2">,</span> which obliged him to live only for his work.</p>
<p class="p3">"Pellerin's a great friend of yours<span class="s2">,</span> isn't he<span class="s2">,</span> Robineau<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"Well —"</p>
<p class="p3">"I'm not reproaching you."</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière made a half-turn and with bowed head<span class="s2">,</span> taking short steps<span class="s2">,</span> paced to and fro with Robineau. A bitter smile<span class="s2">,</span> incomprehensible to Robineau<span class="s2">,</span> came to his lips.</p>
<p class="p3">"Only . . . only you are his chief<span class="s2">,</span> you see."</p>
<p class="p3">"Yes<span class="s2">,</span>" said Robineau.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière was thinking how tonight<span class="s2">,</span> as every night<span class="s2">,</span> a battle was in progress in the southern sky. A moment's weakening of the will might spell defeat<span class="s2">;</span> there was<span class="s2">,</span> perhaps<span class="s2">,</span> much fight­ing to be done before the dawn.</p>
<p class="p3">"You should keep your place<span class="s2">,</span> Robineau." Rivière weighed his words. "You may have to order this pilot to-morrow night to start on a dangerous flight. He will have to obey you."</p>
<p class="p3">"Yes."</p>
<p class="p3">"The lives of men worth more than you are in your hands." He seemed to hesitate. "It's a serious matter."</p>
<p class="p3">For a while Rivière paced the room in si­lence<span class="s2">,</span> taking his little steps.</p>
<p class="p3">"If they obey you because they like you<span class="s2">,</span> Robineau<span class="s2">,</span> you're fooling them. You have no right to ask any sacrifice of them."</p>
<p class="p3">"No<span class="s2">,</span> of course not."</p>
<p class="p3">"And if they think that your friendship will get them off disagreeable duties<span class="s2">,</span> you're fooling them again. They have to obey in any case. Sit down."</p>
<p class="p3">With a touch of his hand Rivière gently propelled Inspector Robineau toward the desk.</p>
<p class="p3">"I am going to teach you a lesson<span class="s2">,</span> Robi­neau. If you feel run down it's not these men's business to give you energy. You are their chief. Your weakness is absurd. Now write!"</p>
<p class="p3">"I –<span class="s2">“</span></p>
<p class="p3">"Write. <span class="s2">‘</span>Inspector Robineau imposes the penalty stated hereunder on Pellerin<span class="s2">,</span> Pilot<span class="s2">,</span> on the following grounds. . . .<span class="s2">’</span> You will dis­cover something to fill in the blanks."</p>
<p class="p3">"Sir!"</p>
<p class="p3">"Act as though you understood<span class="s2">,</span> Robineau. Love the men under your orders—but do not let them know it."</p>
<p class="p3">So<span class="s2">,</span> once more<span class="s2">,</span> Robineau would supervise the cleaning of each propeller-boss<span class="s2">,</span> with zest.</p>
<p class="p3">An emergency landing-ground sent in a radio message. <span class="s2">“</span>Plane in sight. Plane signals: Engine Trouble<span class="s2">;</span> about to land.<span class="s2">”</span></p>
<p class="p3">That meant half an hour lost. Rivière felt that mood of irritation the traveler knows when his express is held up by a signal and the minutes no longer yield their toll of pass­ing hedgerows. The large clock-hand was turning now an empty hemicycle<span class="s2">,</span> within whose compass so many things might have fitted. in. To while away the interval Rivière went out and now the night seemed hollow as a stage without an actor. Wasted—a night like this! He nursed a grudge against that cloud­less sky with its wealth of stars<span class="s2">,</span> the moon's celestial beacon<span class="s2">,</span> the squandered gold of such a night. . . .</p>
<p class="p3">But<span class="s2">,</span> once the plane had taken off<span class="s2">,</span> the night once more grew full of beauty and enthral­ment<span class="s2">;</span> for now the womb of night was carry­ing life<span class="s2">,</span> and over it Rivière kept his watch.</p>
<p class="p3">"What weather have you<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">He had the query transmitted to the crew. Ten seconds later the reply came in: "Very fine."</p>
<p class="p3">There followed a string of names<span class="s2">,</span> towns over which the plane had passed and<span class="s2">,</span> for Rivière's ears<span class="s2">,</span> these were so many names of cities falling one by one before a conqueror.</p>
<p class="p3">Chapter seven</p>
<p class="p3">An Hour Later the Wireless Operator on the Patagonia Mail—</p>
<p class="p3">An hour later the wireless operator on the Patagonia mail felt himself gently lifted as though some one were tugging at his shoul­ders. He looked around<span class="s2">;</span> heavy clouds were putting out the stars. He leaned toward the earth<span class="s2">,</span> trying to see the village lights<span class="s2">,</span> shining like glowworms in the grass<span class="s2">,</span> but in those fields of darkness no light sparkled.</p>
<p class="p3">He felt depressed<span class="s2">;</span> a hard night lay before him<span class="s2">,</span> marches and countermarches<span class="s2">,</span> advances won and lost. He did not understand the pi­lot's tactics<span class="s2">;</span> a little further on and they would hit against that blackness<span class="s2">,</span> like a wall.</p>
<p class="p3">On the rim of the horizon in front he now could see a ghostly flicker<span class="s2">,</span> like the glow above a smithy. He tapped Fabien's shoulder<span class="s2">,</span> but the pilot did not stir.</p>
<p class="p3">Now the first eddies of the distant storm assailed them. The mass of metal heaved gently up<span class="s2">,</span> pressing itself against the opera­tor's limbs<span class="s2">;</span> and then it seemed to melt away<span class="s2">,</span> leaving him for some seconds floating in the darkness<span class="s2">,</span> levitated. He clung to the steel bul­warks with both hands. The red lamp in the cockpit was all that remained to him of the world of men and he shuddered to know him­self descending helpless into the dark heart of night<span class="s2">,</span> with only a little thing<span class="s2">,</span> a miner's safety-lamp<span class="s2">,</span> to see him through. He dared not disturb the pilot to ask his plans<span class="s2">;</span> he tight­ened his grip on the steel ribs and<span class="s2">,</span> bending forward<span class="s2">,</span> fixed his eyes upon the pilot's sha­dowed back.</p>
<p class="p3">In that obscurity the pilot's head and shoul­ders were all that showed themselves. His torso was a block of darkness<span class="s2">,</span> inclined a little to the left<span class="s2">;</span> his face was set toward the storm<span class="s2">,</span> bathed intermittently<span class="s2">,</span> no doubt<span class="s2">,</span> by flicker­ing gleams. He could not see that face<span class="s2">;</span> all the feelings thronging there to meet the onset of the storm were hidden from his eyes<span class="s2">;</span> lips set with anger and resolve<span class="s2">,</span> a white face holding elemental colloquy with the leaping flashes ahead.</p>
<p class="p3">Yet he divined the concentrated force that brooded in that mass of shadow<span class="s2">,</span> and he loved it. True<span class="s2">,</span> it was carrying him toward the tem­pest<span class="s2">,</span> yet it shielded him. True<span class="s2">,</span> those hands<span class="s2">,</span> gripping the controls<span class="s2">,</span> pressed heavy on the storm<span class="s2">,</span> as on some huge beast's neck<span class="s2">,</span> but the strong shoulders never budged<span class="s2">,</span> attesting vast reserves of force. And after all<span class="s2">,</span> he said to him­self<span class="s2">,</span> the pilot's responsible. So<span class="s2">,</span> carried like a pillion-rider on this breakneck gallop into the flames<span class="s2">,</span> he could relish to its full the solid permanence<span class="s2">,</span> the weight and substance im­plicit in that dark form before him.</p>
<p class="p3">On the left<span class="s2">,</span> faint as a far revolving light<span class="s2">,</span> a new storm-center kindled.</p>
<p class="p3">The wireless operator made as if to touch Fabien's shoulder and warn him<span class="s2">,</span> but then he saw him slowly turn his head<span class="s2">,</span> fix his eyes a while on this new enemy and then as slowly return to his previous position<span class="s2">,</span> his neck pressed back against the leather pad<span class="s2">,</span> shoul­ders unmoving as before.</p>

<p class="p3">Rivière Went Out for a Short Walk</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière went out for a short walk<span class="s2">,</span> hoping to shake off his malaise<span class="s2">,</span> which had returned. He who had only lived for action<span class="s2">,</span> dramatic ac­tion<span class="s2">,</span> now felt a curious shifting of the crisis of the drama<span class="s2">,</span> toward his own personality. It came to him that the little people of these little towns<span class="s2">,</span> strolling around their band­stands<span class="s2">,</span> might seem to lead a placid life and yet it had its tragedies<span class="s2">;</span> illness<span class="s2">,</span> love<span class="s2">,</span> bereave­ments<span class="s2">,</span> and that perhaps — His own trouble was teaching him many things<span class="s2">,</span> "opening windows<span class="s2">,</span>" as he put it to himself.</p>
<p class="p3">Toward eleven he was breathing more easily and turned back toward the offices<span class="s2">,</span> slowly shouldering his way through the stag­nant crowds around the cinemas. He glanced up at the stars which glinted on the narrow street<span class="s2">,</span> well-nigh submerged by glaring sky-signs<span class="s2">,</span> and said to himself: "Tonight<span class="s2">,</span> with my two air-mails on their way<span class="s2">,</span> I am responsible for all the sky. That star up there is a sign that is looking for me amongst this crowd — and finds me. That's why I'm feeling out of things<span class="s2">,</span> a man apart."</p>
<p class="p3">A phrase of music came back to him<span class="s2">,</span> some notes from a sonata which he had heard the day before in the company of friends. They had not understood. "That stuff bores us and bores you too<span class="s2">,</span> only you won't admit it!"</p>
<p class="p3">"Perhaps<span class="s2">,</span>" he had replied.</p>
<p class="p3">Then<span class="s2">,</span> as to-night<span class="s2">,</span> he had felt lonely<span class="s2">,</span> but soon had learnt the bounty of such loneliness. The music had breathed to him its message<span class="s2">,</span> to him alone amongst these ordinary folk<span class="s2">,</span> whis­pering its gentle secret. And now the star. Across the shoulders of these people a voice was speaking to him in a tongue that he alone could understand.</p>
<p class="p3">On the pavement they were hustling him about. "No<span class="s2">,</span>" he said to himself<span class="s2">,</span> "I won't get annoyed. I am like the father of a sick child walking in the crowd<span class="s2">,</span> taking short steps<span class="s2">,</span> who carries in his breast the hushed silence of his house."</p>
<p class="p3">He looked upon the people<span class="s2">,</span> seeking to dis­cover which of them<span class="s2">,</span> moving with little steps<span class="s2">,</span> bore in his heart discovery or love—and he remembered the lighthouse-keeper's isola­tion.</p>
<p class="p3">Back in the office<span class="s2">,</span> the silence pleased him. As he slowly walked from one room to an­other<span class="s2">,</span> his footsteps echoed emptiness. The typewriters slept beneath their covers. The cupboard doors were closed upon the serried files. Ten years of work and effort. He felt as if he were visiting the cellars of a bank where wealth lies heavy on the earth. But these regis­ters contained a finer stuff than gold — a stock of living energy<span class="s2">,</span> living but<span class="s2">,</span> like the hoarded gold of banks<span class="s2">,</span> asleep.</p>
<p class="p3">Somewhere he would find the solitary clerk on night duty. Somewhere here a man was working that life and energy should persevere and thus the work goes on from post to post that<span class="s2">,</span> from Toulouse to Buenos Aires<span class="s2">,</span> the chain of flights should stay unbroken.</p>
<p class="p3">"That fellow<span class="s2">,</span>" thought Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> "doesn't know his greatness."</p>
<p class="p3">Somewhere<span class="s2">,</span> too<span class="s2">,</span> the planes were fighting forward<span class="s2">;</span> the night flights went on and on like a persistent malady<span class="s2">,</span> and on them watch must be kept. Help must be given to these men who with hands and knees and breast to breast were wrestling with the darkness<span class="s2">,</span> who knew and only knew an unseen world of shifting things<span class="s2">,</span> whence they must struggle out<span class="s2">,</span> as from an ocean. And the things they said about it afterward were — terrible! "I turned the light on to my hands so as to see them." Velvet of hands bathed in a dim red dark-room glow<span class="s2">;</span> last fragment<span class="s2">,</span> that must be saved<span class="s2">,</span> of a lost world.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière opened the door of the Traffic Office. A solitary lamp shone in one corner<span class="s2">,</span> making a little pool of light. The clicking of a single typewriter gave meaning to the si­lence<span class="s2">,</span> but did not fill it. Sometimes the tele­phone buzzed faintly and the clerk on duty rose obedient to its sad<span class="s2">,</span> reiterated call. As he took down the receiver that invisible distress was soothed and a gentle<span class="s2">,</span> very gentle murmur of voices filled the coign of shadow.</p>
<p class="p3">Impassive the man returned to his desk<span class="s2">,</span> for drowsiness and solitude had sealed his fea­tures on a secret unconfessed. And yet — what menace it may hold<span class="s2">,</span> a call from the outer darkness when two postal planes are on their way! Rivière thought of telegrams that invad­ed the peace of families sitting round their lamp at night and that grief which<span class="s2">,</span> for seconds that seem unending<span class="s2">,</span> keeps its secret on the father's face. Waves<span class="s2">,</span> so weak at first<span class="s2">,</span> so distant from the call they carry<span class="s2">,</span> and so calm<span class="s2">;</span> and yet each quiet purring of the bell held<span class="s2">,</span> for Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> a faint echo of that cry. Each time the man came back from the shadow toward his lamp<span class="s2">,</span> like a diver returning to the surface<span class="s2">,</span> the solitude made his movements heavy with their secret<span class="s2">,</span> slow as a swimmer's in the under­tow.</p>
<p class="p3">"Wait! I'll answer."</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière unhooked the receiver and a world of murmurs hummed in his ears.</p>
<p class="p3">"Rivière speaking."</p>
<p class="p3">Confused sounds<span class="s2">,</span> then a voice: "I'll put you on the radio station."</p>
<p class="p3">A rattle of plugs into the standard<span class="s2">,</span> then another voice: "Radio Station speaking. I'll pass you the messages."</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière noted them<span class="s2">,</span> nodding. "Good. . . . Good . . ."</p>
<p class="p3">Nothing important<span class="s2">,</span> the usual routine news. Rio de Janeiro asking for information<span class="s2">,</span> Mon­tevideo reporting on the weather<span class="s2">,</span> Mendoza on the plant. Familiar sounds.</p>
<p class="p3">"And the planes<span class="s2">?</span>" he asked.</p>
<p class="p3">"The weather's stormy. We don't hear them tonight."</p>
<p class="p3">"Right!"</p>
<p class="p3">The night is fine here and starry<span class="s2">,</span> Rivière thought<span class="s2">,</span> yet those fellows can detect in it the breath of the distant storm.</p>
<p class="p3">"That's all for the present<span class="s2">,</span>" he said.</p>
<p class="p3">As Rivière rose the clerk accosted him: "Papers to sign<span class="s2">,</span> sir."</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière discovered that he greatly liked this subordinate of his who was bearing<span class="s2">,</span> too<span class="s2">,</span> the brunt of night. "A comrade in arms<span class="s2">,</span>" he thought. "But he will never guess<span class="s2">,</span> I fancy<span class="s2">,</span> how tonight's vigil brings us near each other."</p>
<p class="p3">chapter nine</p>
<p class="p3">As He Was Returning to His Private Office —</p>
<p class="p3">As he was returning to his private office<span class="s2">,</span> a sheaf of papers in his hand<span class="s2">,</span> Rivière felt the stab of pain in his right side which had been worrying him for some weeks past.</p>
<p class="p3">"That's bad. . . ."</p>
<p class="p3">He leaned against the wall a moment. "It's absurd!"</p>
<p class="p3">Then he made his way to his chair.</p>
<p class="p3">Once again he felt like some old lion fallen in a trap and a great sadness came upon him. "To think I've come to this after all those years of work! I'm fifty<span class="s2">;</span> all that time I've filled my life with work<span class="s2">,</span> trained myself<span class="s2">,</span> fought my way<span class="s2">,</span> altered the course of events and here's this damned thing getting a hold of me<span class="s2">,</span> ob­sessing me till it seems the only thing that matters in the world. It's absurd!"</p>
<p class="p3">He wiped away a drop or two of sweat<span class="s2">,</span> waited till the pain had ebbed and settled down to work<span class="s2">,</span> examining the memoranda on his table.</p>
<p class="p3">"In taking down Motor 301 at Buenos Aires we discovered that . . . The employee re­sponsible will be severely punished."</p>
<p class="p3">He signed his name.</p>
<p class="p3">"The Florianopolis staff<span class="s2">,</span> having failed to comply with orders ..</p>
<p class="p3">He signed.</p>
<p class="p3">"As a disciplinary measure Airport Super­visor Richard is transferred on the following grounds. . . ."</p>
<p class="p3">He signed.</p>
<p class="p3">Then<span class="s2">,</span> as the pain in his side<span class="s2">,</span> slumbering but persistent<span class="s2">,</span> new as a new meaning in life<span class="s2">,</span> drove his thoughts inward toward himself<span class="s2">,</span> an almost bitter mood came over him.</p>
<p class="p3">"Am I just or unjust<span class="s2">?</span> I've no idea. All I know is that when I hit hard there are fewer accidents. It isn't the individual that's respon­sible but a sort of hidden force and I can't get at it without—getting at every one! If I were merely just<span class="s2">,</span> every night flight would mean a risk of death."</p>
<p class="p3">A sort of disgust came over him<span class="s2">,</span> that he had given himself so hard a road to follow. Pity is a fine thing<span class="s2">,</span> he thought. Lost in his musings<span class="s2">,</span> he turned the pages over.</p>
<p class="p3">"Roblet<span class="s2">,</span> as from this day<span class="s2">,</span> is struck off the strength. . . ."</p>
<p class="p3">He remembered the old fellow and their talk the evening before.</p>
<p class="p3">"There's no way out of it<span class="s2">,</span> an example must be made."</p>
<p class="p3">"But<span class="s2">,</span> sir. . . . It was the only time<span class="s2">,</span> just once in a way<span class="s2">,</span> sir . . . and I've been hard at it all my life!"</p>
<p class="p3">"An example must be made."</p>
<p class="p3">"But . . . but<span class="s2">,</span> sir. Please see here<span class="s2">,</span> sir."</p>
<p class="p3">A tattered pocket-book<span class="s2">,</span> a newspaper pic­ture showing young Roblet standing beside an aeroplane. Rivière saw how the old hands were trembling upon this little scrap of fame.</p>
<p class="p3">"It was in nineteen ten<span class="s2">,</span> sir. That was the first plane in Argentina and I assembled it. I've been in aviation since nineteen ten<span class="s2">,</span> think of it<span class="s2">,</span> sir! Twenty years! So how can you say . . . <span class="s2">?</span> And the young 'uns<span class="s2">,</span> sir<span class="s2">,</span> won't they just laugh about it in the shop! Won't they just chuckle!"</p>
<p class="p3">"I can't help that."</p>
<p class="p3">"And my kids<span class="s2">,</span> sir. I've a family."</p>
<p class="p3">"I told you you could have a job as a fitter."</p>
<p class="p3">"But there's my good name<span class="s2">,</span> sir<span class="s2">,</span> my name . . . after twenty years' experience. An old employee like me!"</p>
<p class="p3">"As a fitter."</p>
<p class="p3">"No<span class="s2">,</span> sir<span class="s2">,</span> I can't see my way to that. I some­how can't<span class="s2">,</span> sir!"</p>
<p class="p3">The old hands trembled and Rivière averted his eyes from their plump<span class="s2">,</span> creased flesh which had a beauty of its own.</p>
<p class="p3">"No<span class="s2">,</span> sir<span class="s2">,</span> no. . . . And there's something more I'd like to say."</p>
<p class="p3">"That will do."</p>
<p class="p3">Not he<span class="s2">,</span> thought Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> it wasn't he whom I dismissed so brutally<span class="s2">,</span> but the mischief for which<span class="s2">,</span> perhaps<span class="s2">,</span> he was not responsible<span class="s2">,</span> though it came to pass through him. For<span class="s2">,</span> he mused<span class="s2">,</span> we can command events and they obey us<span class="s2">;</span> and thus we are creators. These humble men<span class="s2">,</span> too<span class="s2">,</span> are things and we create them. Or cast them aside when mischief comes about through them.</p>
<p class="p3">"There's something more I'd like to say." What did the poor old fellow want to say<span class="s2">?</span> That I was robbing him of all that made life dear<span class="s2">?</span> That he loved the clang of tools upon the steel of airplanes<span class="s2">,</span> that all the ardent poetry of life would now be lost to him . . . and then<span class="s2">,</span> a man must live<span class="s2">?</span></p>
<p class="p3">"I am very tired<span class="s2">,</span>" Rivière murmured and his fever rose<span class="s2">,</span> insidiously caressing him. "I liked that old chap's face." He tapped the sheet of paper with his finger. It came back to him<span class="s2">,</span> the look of the old man's hands and he now seemed to see them shape a faltering gesture of thankfulness. "That's all right<span class="s2">,</span>" was all he had to say. "That's right. Stay!" And then — He pictured the torrent of joy that would flow through those old hands. Nothing in all the world<span class="s2">,</span> it seemed to him<span class="s2">,</span> could be more beautiful than that joy revealed not on a face<span class="s2">,</span> but in those toil-worn hands. Shall I tear up this paper<span class="s2">?</span> He imagined the old man's homecoming to his family<span class="s2">,</span> his modest pride.</p>
<p class="p3">"So they're keeping you on<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"What do you think<span class="s2">?</span> It was I who assem­bled the first plane in Argentina!"</p>
<p class="p3">The old fellow would get back his prestige<span class="s2">,</span> the youngsters cease to laugh.</p>
<p class="p3">As he was asking himself if he would tear it up<span class="s2">,</span> the telephone rang.</p>
<p class="p3">There was a long pause<span class="s2">,</span> full of the reso­nance and depth that wind and distance give to voices.</p>
<p class="p3">"Landing-ground speaking. Who is there<span class="s2">?</span>" "Rivière."</p>
<p class="p3">"No. 650 is on the tarmac<span class="s2">,</span> sir."</p>
<p class="p3">"Good."</p>
<p class="p3">"We've managed to fix it up<span class="s2">,</span> but the elec­tric circuit needed overhauling at the last minute<span class="s2">;</span> the connections had been bungled."</p>
<p class="p3">"Yes. Who did the wiring<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"We will inquire and<span class="s2">,</span> if you agree<span class="s2">,</span> we'll make an example. It's a serious matter when the lights give out on board."</p>
<p class="p3">"You're right."</p>
<p class="p3">If<span class="s2">,</span> Rivière was thinking<span class="s2">,</span> one doesn't up­root the mischief whenever and wherever it crops up<span class="s2">,</span> the lights may fail and it would be criminal to let it pass when<span class="s2">,</span> by some chance<span class="s2">,</span> it happens to unmask its instrument<span class="s2">;</span> Roblet shall go.</p>
<p class="p3">The clerk<span class="s2">,</span> who had noticed nothing<span class="s2">,</span> was busy with his typewriter.</p>
<p class="p3">"What's that<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"The fortnightly accounts."</p>
<p class="p3">"Why not ready<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"I . . . I . . ."</p>
<p class="p3">"We'll see about that."</p>
<p class="p3">Curious<span class="s2">,</span> mused Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> how things take the upper hand<span class="s2">,</span> how a vast dark force<span class="s2">,</span> the force that thrusts up virgin forests<span class="s2">,</span> shows it­self whenever a great work is in the making! And he thought of temples dragged asunder by frail liana tendrils.</p>
<p class="p3">A great work. . . .</p>
<p class="p3">And<span class="s2">,</span> heartening himself<span class="s2">,</span> he let his thought flow on. These men of mine<span class="s2">,</span> I love them<span class="s2">;</span> it's not they whom I'm against<span class="s2">,</span> but what comes about through them. . . . His heart was throbbing rapidly and it hurt him. . . . No<span class="s2">,</span> I cannot say if I am doing right or what pre­cise value should be set on a human life<span class="s2">,</span> or suffering<span class="s2">,</span> or justice. How should I know the value of a man's joys<span class="s2">?</span> Or of a trembling hand<span class="s2">?</span> Of kindness<span class="s2">,</span> or pity<span class="s2">?</span></p>
<p class="p3">Life is so full of contradictions<span class="s2">;</span> a man muddles through it as best he can. But to endure<span class="s2">,</span> to create<span class="s2">,</span> to barter this vile body. . . .</p>
<p class="p3">As if to conclude his musings he pressed the bell-push.</p>
<p class="p3">"Ring up the pilot of the Europe mail and tell him to come and see me before he leaves."</p>
<p class="p3">For he was thinking: I must make sure he doesn't turn back needlessly. If I don't stir my men up the night is sure to make them nervous.</p>
<p class="p3">chapter ten</p>
<p class="p3">Roused By The Call<span class="s2">,</span> The Pilot's Wife —</p>
<p class="p3">Roused by the call<span class="s2">,</span> the pilot's wife looked musingly at her husband. I'll let him sleep a bit longer<span class="s2">,</span> she thought.</p>
<p class="p3">She admired that spanned bare chest of his and the thought came to her of a well-built ship. In the quiet bed<span class="s2">,</span> as in a harbor<span class="s2">,</span> he was sleeping and<span class="s2">,</span> lest anything should spoil his rest<span class="s2">,</span> she smoothed out a fold of sheet<span class="s2">,</span> a little wave of shadow<span class="s2">,</span> with her hand<span class="s2">,</span> bringing calm upon the bed<span class="s2">,</span> as a divine hand calms the sea.</p>
<p class="p3">Rising<span class="s2">,</span> she opened the window and felt the wind on her face. Their room overlooked Buenos Aires. A dance was going on in a house near by and the music came to her upon the wind<span class="s2">,</span> for this was the hour of leisure and amusement. In a hundred thousand barracks this city billeted its men and all was peaceful and secure<span class="s2">;</span> but<span class="s2">,</span> the woman thought<span class="s2">,</span> soon there'll be a cry "To arms!" and only one man — mine — will answer it. True<span class="s2">,</span> he rested still<span class="s2">,</span> yet his was the ominous rest of reserves soon to be summoned to the front. This town at rest did not protect him<span class="s2">;</span> its light would seem as nothing when<span class="s2">,</span> like a young god<span class="s2">,</span> he rose above its golden dust. She looked at the strong arms which<span class="s2">,</span> in an hour<span class="s2">,</span> would decide the fortune of the Europe mail<span class="s2">,</span> bearing a high responsibility<span class="s2">,</span> like a city's fate. The thought troubled her. That this man alone<span class="s2">,</span> amongst those millions<span class="s2">,</span> was destined for the sacrifice made her sad. It estranged him from her love. She had cherished him<span class="s2">,</span> watched over him<span class="s2">,</span> not for herself but for this night which was to take him. For struggles<span class="s2">,</span> fears<span class="s2">,</span> and victories which she would never know. Wild things they were<span class="s2">,</span> those hands of his<span class="s2">,</span> and only tamed to tender­ness<span class="s2">;</span> their real task was dark to her. She knew this man's smile<span class="s2">,</span> his gentle ways of love<span class="s2">,</span> but not his godlike fury in the storm. She might snare him in a fragile net of music<span class="s2">,</span> love and flowers<span class="s2">,</span> but<span class="s2">,</span> at each departure<span class="s2">,</span> he would break forth without<span class="s2">,</span> it seemed to her<span class="s2">,</span> the least regret.</p>
<p class="p3">He opened his eyes. "What time is it<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"Midnight."</p>
<p class="p3">"How's the weather<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"I don't know."</p>
<p class="p3">He rose and<span class="s2">,</span> stretching himself<span class="s2">,</span> walked to the window. "Won't be too cold. What's the wind<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"How should I know<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">He leaned out. "Southerly. That's tophole. It'll hold as far as Brazil anyhow."</p>
<p class="p3">He looked at the moon and reckoned up his riches and then his gaze fell upon the town below. Not warm or kind or bright it seemed to him<span class="s2">;</span> already in his mind's eye its worthless<span class="s2">,</span> shining sands were running out.</p>
<p class="p3">"What are you thinking about<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">He was thinking of the fog he might en­counter toward Porto Allegre.</p>
<p class="p3">"I've made my plans. I know exactly where to turn."</p>
<p class="p3">He still was bending down<span class="s2">,</span> inhaling deeply like a man about to plunge<span class="s2">,</span> naked<span class="s2">,</span> into the sea.</p>
<p class="p3">"You don't even seem to mind it! How long will you be away<span class="s2">?</span>" she asked.</p>
<p class="p3">A week or ten days<span class="s2">,</span> he couldn't say. "Mind it<span class="s2">?</span>" Why should he<span class="s2">?</span> All those cities<span class="s2">,</span> plains<span class="s2">,</span> and mountains. . . . In freedom he was go­ing out to conquer them. In under an hour<span class="s2">,</span> he thought<span class="s2">,</span> he would have annexed Buenos Aires and tossed it aside!</p>
<p class="p3">He smiled at his thoughts. This town . . . it will soon be left behind. It's fine starting out at night. One opens out the gas<span class="s2">,</span> facing south<span class="s2">,</span> and ten seconds later swings the landscape roundabout<span class="s2">,</span> heading up north. The town looks like the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p class="p3">She thought of all a man must lay aside to conquer. "So you don't like your home<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"I do like my home."</p>
<p class="p3">But his wife knew that he was already on his way and even now his sturdy shoulders were pressing up against the sky.</p>
<p class="p3">She pointed to the sky. "A fine night. See<span class="s2">,</span> your road is paved with stars!"</p>
<p class="p3">He laughed. "Yes."</p>
<p class="p3">She rested her hand on his shoulder and its moist warmth disquieted her<span class="s2">;</span> did some dan­ger threaten this young flesh of his<span class="s2">?</span></p>
<p class="p3">"I know how strong you are<span class="s2">,</span> but — do take care!"</p>
<p class="p3">"Of course I'll take care."</p>
<p class="p3">Then he began dressing. For the occasion he chose the coarsest<span class="s2">,</span> roughest fabrics<span class="s2">,</span> the heaviest of leather — a peasant's kit. The hea­vier he grew<span class="s2">,</span> the more she admired him. Her­self she buckled his belt<span class="s2">,</span> helped to pull his boots on.</p>
<p class="p3">"These boots pinch me!"</p>
<p class="p3">"Here are the others."</p>
<p class="p3">"Bring a cord for my emergency-lamp."</p>
<p class="p3">She looked at him<span class="s2">,</span> set to rights the last flaw in his armor<span class="s2">;</span> all fell into place.</p>
<p class="p3">"You look splendid."</p>
<p class="p3">Then she noticed that he was carefully brushing his hair.</p>
<p class="p3">"For the benefit of the stars<span class="s2">?</span>" she ques­tioned.</p>
<p class="p3">"I don't want to feel old."</p>
<p class="p3">"I'm jealous."</p>
<p class="p3">He laughed again and kissed her<span class="s2">,</span> pressing her to his heavy garments. Then he lifted her from the ground between his outstretched arms like a little girl<span class="s2">,</span> and laughing still<span class="s2">,</span> de­posited her on the bed.</p>
<p class="p3">"Go to sleep!"</p>
<p class="p3">He shut the door behind him and passing amongst the indistinguishable folk of night<span class="s2">,</span> took the first step toward his conquests.</p>
<p class="p3">She remained<span class="s2">,</span> sadly looking at these flowers and books<span class="s2">,</span> little friendly things which meant for him no more than the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p class="p3">chapter eleven</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière Greeted Him.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière greeted him.</p>
<p class="p3">"That's a nice trick you played on me<span class="s2">,</span> your last trip! You turned back though the weather reports were good. You could have pushed through all right. Get the wind up<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">Surprised<span class="s2">,</span> the pilot found no answer. He slowly rubbed his hands one on the other. Then<span class="s2">,</span> raising his head<span class="s2">,</span> he looked Rivière in the eyes.</p>
<p class="p3">"Yes<span class="s2">,</span>" he answered.</p>
<p class="p3">Deep in himself Rivière felt sorry for this brave fellow who had been afraid. The pilot tried to explain.</p>
<p class="p3">"I couldn't see a thing. No doubt<span class="s2">,</span> further on . . . perhaps . . . the radio said. . . . But my lamp was getting weak and I couldn't see my hands. I tried turning on my flying-light so as to spot a wing anyhow<span class="s2">,</span> but I saw nothing. It was like being at the bottom of a huge pit<span class="s2">,</span> and no getting out of it. Then my engine started a rattle."</p>
<p class="p3">"No."</p>
<p class="p3">"No<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"No<span class="s2">,</span> we had a look at it. In perfect order. But a man always thinks the engine's rattling when he gets the wind up."</p>
<p class="p3">"And who wouldn't<span class="s2">?</span> The mountains were above me. When I tried to climb I got caught in heavy squalls When one can't see a damned thing<span class="s2">,</span> squalls<span class="s2">,</span> you know. . . . In­stead of climbing I lost three hundred feet or more. I couldn't even see the gyroscope or the manometers. It struck me that the engine was running badly and heating up<span class="s2">,</span> and the oil-pressure was going down. And it was dark as a plague of Egypt. Damned glad I was to see the lights of a town again."</p>
<p class="p3">"You've too much imagination. That's what it is."</p>
<p class="p3">The pilot left him.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière sank back into the arm-chair and ran his fingers through his grizzled hair.</p>
<p class="p3">The pluckiest of my men<span class="s2">,</span> he thought. It was a fine thing he did that night<span class="s2">,</span> but I've stopped him from being afraid.</p>
<p class="p3">He felt a mood of weakness coming over him again.</p>
<p class="p3">To make oneself beloved one need only show pity. I show little pity<span class="s2">,</span> or I hide it. Sure enough it would be fine to create friendships and human kindness around me. A doctor can enjoy that in the course of his profession. But I'm the servant of events and<span class="s2">,</span> to make others serve them too<span class="s2">,</span> I've got to temper my men like steel. That dark necessity is with me every night when I read over the flight reports. If I am slack and let events take charge<span class="s2">,</span> trusting to routine<span class="s2">,</span> always mysteri­ously something seems to happen. It is as if my will alone forbade the plane in flight from breaking or the storm to hold the mail up. My power sometimes amazes me.</p>
<p class="p3">His thoughts flowed on.</p>
<p class="p3">Simple enough<span class="s2">,</span> perhaps. Like a gardener's endless labor on his lawn<span class="s2">;</span> the mere pressure of his hand drives back into the soil the virgin forest which the earth will engender time and time again.</p>
<p class="p3">His thoughts turned to the pilot.</p>
<p class="p3">I am saving him from fear. I was not at­tacking him but<span class="s2">,</span> across him<span class="s2">,</span> that stubborn inertia which paralyzes men who face the un­known. If I listen and sympathize<span class="s2">,</span> if I take his adventure seriously<span class="s2">,</span> he will fancy he is returning from a land of mystery<span class="s2">,</span> and mystery alone is at the root of fear. We must do away with mystery. Men who have gone down into the pit of darkness must come up and say — there's nothing in it! This man must enter the inmost heart of night<span class="s2">,</span> that clotted dark­ness<span class="s2">,</span> without even his little miner's davy<span class="s2">,</span> whose light<span class="s2">,</span> falling only on a hand or wing<span class="s2">,</span> suffices to push the unknown a shoulder's breadth away.</p>
<p class="p3">Yet<span class="s2">,</span> a silent communion<span class="s2">,</span> deep within them<span class="s2">,</span> united Rivière and his pilots in the battle. All were like shipmates<span class="s2">,</span> sharing a com­mon will to victory.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière remembered other battles he had joined to conquer night. In official circles darkness was dreaded as a desert unexplored. The idea of launching a craft at a hundred and fifty miles an hour against the storm and mists and all the solid obstacles night veils in darkness might suit the military arm<span class="s2">;</span> you leave on a fine night<span class="s2">,</span> drop bombs and return to your starting-point. But regular night-serv­ices were doomed to fail. "It's a matter of life and death<span class="s2">,</span>" said Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> "for the lead we gain by day on ships and railways is lost each night."</p>
<p class="p3">Disgusted<span class="s2">,</span> he had heard them prate of balance-sheets<span class="s2">,</span> insurance and<span class="s2">,</span> above all<span class="s2">,</span> pub­lic opinion. "Public opinion!" he exclaimed. "The public does as it's told!" But it was all waste of time<span class="s2">,</span> he was saying to himself.</p>
<p class="p3">There's something far above all that. A living thing forces its way through<span class="s2">,</span> makes its own laws to live by and nothing can resist it. Rivière had no notion when or how commercial aviation would tackle the problem of night-flying but its inevitable solution must be pre­pared for.</p>
<p class="p3">Those green table-cloths over which he had leaned<span class="s2">,</span> his chin propped on his arm<span class="s2">,</span> well he remembered them! And his feeling of power as he heard the others' quibbles! Futile these had seemed<span class="s2">,</span> doomed from the outset by the force of life. He felt the weight of energy that gathered in him. And I shall win<span class="s2">,</span> thought Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> for the weight of argument is on my side. That is the natural trend of things. They urged him to propose a utopian scheme<span class="s2">,</span> de­void of every risk. "Experience will guide us to the rules<span class="s2">,</span>" he said. "You cannot make rules precede practical experience."</p>
<p class="p3">After a hard year's struggle<span class="s2">,</span> Rivière got his way. "His faith saw him through<span class="s2">,</span>" said some<span class="s2">,</span> but others: "No<span class="s2">,</span> his tenacity. Why<span class="s2">,</span> the fel­low's as obstinate as a bear!" But Rivière put his success down to the fact that he had lent his weight to the better cause.</p>
<p class="p3">Safety first was the obsession of those early days. Planes were to leave only an hour before dawn<span class="s2">,</span> to land only an hour after sunset. When Rivière felt surer of his ground<span class="s2">,</span> then and only then did he venture to send his planes into the depth of night. And now<span class="s2">,</span> with few to back him<span class="s2">,</span> disowned by nearly all<span class="s2">,</span> he plowed a lonely furrow.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière rang up to learn the latest messages from the planes in flight.</p>
<p class="p3">chapter twelve</p>
<p class="p3">Now The Patagonia Mail Was Entering The Storm —</p>
<p class="p3">Now the Patagonia mail was entering the storm and Fabien abandoned all idea of cir­cumventing it<span class="s2">;</span> it was too widespread for that<span class="s2">,</span> he reckoned<span class="s2">,</span> for the vista of lightning-flashes led far inland<span class="s2">,</span> exposing battlement on battle­ment of clouds. He decided to try passing be­low it<span class="s2">,</span> ready to beat a retreat if things took a bad turn.</p>
<p class="p3">He read his altitude<span class="s2">,</span> five thousand five hundred feet<span class="s2">,</span> and pressed the controls with his palms to bring it down. The engine started thudding violently<span class="s2">,</span> setting all the plane aquiver. Fabien corrected the gliding angle approximately<span class="s2">,</span> verifying on the map the height of the hills<span class="s2">,</span> some sixteen hundred feet. To keep a safety margin he determined to fly at a trifle above two thousand<span class="s2">,</span> staking his altitude as a gambler risks his fortune.</p>
<p class="p3">An eddy dragged him down<span class="s2">,</span> making the plane tremble still more harshly and he felt the threat of unseen avalanches that toppled all about him. He dreamt an instant of retreat and its guerdon of a hundred thousand stars<span class="s2">,</span> but did not shift his course by one degree.</p>
<p class="p3">Fabien weighed his chances<span class="s2">;</span> probably this was just a local storm<span class="s2">,</span> as Trelew<span class="s2">,</span> the next halt<span class="s2">,</span> was signaling a sky only three-quarters overcast. A bare twenty minutes more of solid murk and he would be through with it. Nevertheless the pilot felt uneasy. Leaning to his left<span class="s2">,</span> to windward<span class="s2">,</span> he sought to catch those vague gleams which<span class="s2">,</span> even in darkest night<span class="s2">,</span> flit here and there. But even those vagrant gleams were gone<span class="s2">;</span> at most there lingered patches in the mass of shadow where the night seemed less opaque<span class="s2">,</span> or was it only that his eyes were growing strained<span class="s2">?</span></p>
<p class="p3">The wireless operator handed him a slip of paper.</p>
<p class="p3">"Where are we<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">Fabien would have given much to know. "Can't say exactly<span class="s2">,</span>" he answered. "We are flying by compass across a storm."</p>
<p class="p3">He leaned down again. The flame from the exhaust was getting on his nerves. There it was<span class="s2">,</span> clinging to the motor like a spray of fire-flowers<span class="s2">,</span> so pale it seemed that moonlight would have quelled it<span class="s2">,</span> but<span class="s2">,</span> in this nothing­ness<span class="s2">,</span> engulfing all the visible world. He watched it streaming stiffly out into the wind<span class="s2">,</span> like a torch-flame.</p>
<p class="p3">Every thirty seconds Fabien bent down into the cockpit to check the gyroscope and compass. He dared not light the dim red lamps which would have dazzled his eyes for some moments<span class="s2">,</span> but the luminous dial-hands were ceaselessly emitting their pale and starry radiance. And in all those needles and printed figures the pilot found an illusive reassurance<span class="s2">,</span> as in the cabin of a ship swept by the waves. For<span class="s2">,</span> like a very sea of strange fatality<span class="s2">,</span> the night was rolling up against him with all its rocks and reefs and wreckage.</p>
<p class="p3">"Where are we<span class="s2">?</span>" the operator asked again.</p>
<p class="p3">Fabien drew himself up and<span class="s2">,</span> leaning to the left<span class="s2">,</span> resumed his tremendous vigil. He had no notion left how many hours more and what efforts would be needed to deliver him from fettering darkness. Would he ever come clear<span class="s2">,</span> he wondered<span class="s2">,</span> for he was staking his life on this little slip of dirty crumpled paper<span class="s2">,</span> which he unfolded and re-read a thousand times to nurse his hopes: Trelew. Sky three-quarters overcast. Westerly breeze. If there still re­mained a clear patch over Trelew<span class="s2">,</span> he would presently glimpse its lights across a cloud-rift. Unless. . . .</p>
<p class="p3">That promise of a faint gleam far ahead beckoned him on<span class="s2">;</span> but<span class="s2">,</span> to make sure<span class="s2">,</span> he scribbled a message to the radio operator. "Don't know if I can get through. Ask if the weather's holding out behind."</p>
<p class="p3">The answer appalled him.</p>
<p class="p3">"Commodoro reports: Impossible return here. Storm."</p>
<p class="p3">He was beginning to measure this unfore­seen offensive<span class="s2">,</span> launched from the Cordillera toward the sea. Before he could make them the storm would have burst upon the cities.</p>
<p class="p3">"Get the San Antonio weather report."</p>
<p class="p3">"San Antonio reports: West wind rising. Storm in the west. Sky three-quarters over­cast. San Antonio picking up badly on ac­count of interferences. I'm having trouble too. I shall have to pull up the aerial on ac­count of the lightning. Will you turn back<span class="s2">?</span> What are your plans<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"Stow your damned questions! Get Bahia Blanca!"</p>
<p class="p3">"Bahia Blanca reports: Violent westerly gale over Bahia Blanca expected in less than twenty minutes."</p>
<p class="p3">"Ask Trelew."</p>
<p class="p3">"Trelew reports: Westerly gale<span class="s2">;</span> a hundred feet per second<span class="s2">;</span> rain squalls."</p>
<p class="p3">"Inform Buenos Aires: We are cut off on all sides<span class="s2">;</span> storm developing over a depth of eight hundred miles<span class="s2">;</span> no visibility. What shall we do<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">A shoreless night<span class="s2">,</span> the pilot thought<span class="s2">,</span> lead­ing to no anchorage <span class="s2">(</span>for every port was un­attainable<span class="s2">,</span> it seemed<span class="s2">),</span> nor toward dawn. In an hour and twenty minutes the fuel would run out. Sooner or later he must blindly founder in the sea of darkness. Ah<span class="s2">,</span> if only he could have won through to daylight!</p>
<p class="p3">Fabien pictured the dawn as a beach of golden sand where a man might get a foot­hold after this hard night. Beneath him the plains<span class="s2">,</span> like friendly shores<span class="s2">,</span> would spread their safety. The quiet land would bear its sleeping farms and flocks and hills. And all the flotsam swirling in the shadows would lose its menace. If it were possible<span class="s2">,</span> how gladly he would swim toward the strand of daylight! But<span class="s2">,</span> well he knew<span class="s2">,</span> he was surrounded<span class="s2">;</span> for better or for worse the end would come with­in this murk of darkness. . . . Sometimes<span class="s2">,</span> indeed<span class="s2">,</span> when daybreak came<span class="s2">,</span> it seemed like convalescence after illness.</p>
<p class="p3">What use to turn his eyes toward the east<span class="s2">,</span> home of the sun<span class="s2">?</span> Between them lay a gulf of night so deep that he could never clamber up again.</p>
<p class="p3">chapter thirteen</p>
<p class="p3">The Asuncion Mail Is Making Good Headway —</p>
<p class="p3">"The Asuncion mail is making good head­way<span class="s2">;</span> it should be in at about two. The Pata­gonia mail<span class="s2">,</span> however<span class="s2">,</span> seems to be in difficul­ties and we expect it to be much overdue."</p>
<p class="p3">"Very good<span class="s2">,</span> Monsieur Rivière."</p>
<p class="p3">"Quite possibly we won't make the Europe mail wait for it<span class="s2">;</span> as soon as Asuncion's in<span class="s2">,</span> come for instructions<span class="s2">,</span> please. Hold yourself in readiness."</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière read again the weather reports from the northern sectors. "Clear sky<span class="s2">;</span> full moon<span class="s2">;</span> no wind." The mountains of Brazil were standing stark and clear against the moonlit sky<span class="s2">,</span> the tangled tresses of their jet-black forests falling sheer into a silver tracery of sea. Upon those forests the moonbeams played and played in vain<span class="s2">,</span> tingeing their blackness with no light. Black<span class="s2">,</span> too<span class="s2">,</span> as drifting wreckage<span class="s2">,</span> the islands flecked the sea. But all the outward air-route was flooded by that ex­haustless fountain of moonlight.</p>
<p class="p3">If Rivière now gave orders for the start<span class="s2">,</span> the crew of the Europe mail would enter a stable world<span class="s2">,</span> softly illuminated all night long. A land which held no threat for the just bal­ance of light and shade<span class="s2">,</span> unruffled by the least caress of those cool winds which<span class="s2">,</span> when they freshen<span class="s2">,</span> can ruin a whole sky in an hour or two.</p>
<p class="p3">Facing this wide radiance<span class="s2">,</span> like a prospector eyeing a forbidden gold-field<span class="s2">,</span> Rivière hesi­tated. What was happening in the south put Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> sole protagonist of night flights<span class="s2">,</span> in the wrong. His opponents would make such moral capital out of a disaster in Patagonia that all Rivière's faith would henceforth be unavailing. Not that his faith wavered<span class="s2">;</span> if<span class="s2">,</span> through a fissure in his work<span class="s2">,</span> a tragedy had entered in<span class="s2">,</span> well<span class="s2">,</span> the tragedy might prove the fissure—but it proved nothing else. Perhaps<span class="s2">,</span> he thought<span class="s2">,</span> it would be well to have look-out posts in the west. That must be seen to. "After all<span class="s2">,</span>" he said to himself<span class="s2">,</span> "my previous argu­ments hold good as ever and the possibilities of accident are reduced by one<span class="s2">,</span> the one to­night has illustrated." The strong are strengthened by reverses<span class="s2">;</span> the trouble is that the true meaning of events scores next to nothing in the match we play with men. Appearances decide our gains or losses and the points are trumpery. And a mere semblance of defeat may hopelessly checkmate us.</p>
<p class="p3">He summoned an employee. "Still no radio from Bahia Blanca<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"No."</p>
<p class="p3">"Ring up the station on the phone."</p>
<p class="p3">Five minutes later he made further in­quiries. "Why don't you pass on the mes­sages<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"We can't hear the mail."</p>
<p class="p3">"He's not sending anything<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"Can't say. Too many storms. Even if he was sending we shouldn't pick it up."</p>
<p class="p3">"Can you get Trelew<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"We can't hear Trelew."</p>
<p class="p3">"Telephone."</p>
<p class="p3">"We've tried. The line's broken."</p>
<p class="p3">"How's the weather your end<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"Threatening. Very sultry. Lightning in the west and south."</p>
<p class="p3">"Wind<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"Moderate so far. But in ten minutes the storm will break<span class="s2">;</span> the lightning's coming up fast."</p>
<p class="p3">Silence.</p>
<p class="p3">"Hullo<span class="s2">,</span> Bahia Blanca! You hear me<span class="s2">?</span> Good. Call me again in ten minutes."</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière looked through the telegrams from the southern stations. All alike reported: No message from the plane. Some had ceased by now to answer Buenos Aires and the patch of silent areas was spreading on the map as the cyclone swept upon the little towns and one by one<span class="s2">,</span> behind closed doors<span class="s2">,</span> each house along the lightless streets grew isolated from the outer world<span class="s2">,</span> lonely as a ship on a dark sea. And only dawn would rescue them.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière poring on the map<span class="s2">,</span> still hoped against hope to discover a haven of clear sky<span class="s2">,</span> for he had telegraphed to the police at more than thirty up-country police-stations and their replies were coming in. And the radio-posts over twelve hundred miles of country had orders to advise Buenos Aires within thirty seconds if any message from the plane was picked up<span class="s2">,</span> so that Fabien might learn at once whither to fly for refuge.</p>
<p class="p3">The employees had been warned to attend at 1 A. M. and were now at their posts. Some­how<span class="s2">,</span> mysteriously<span class="s2">,</span> a rumor was gaining ground that perhaps the night flights would be suspended in the future and the Europe mail would leave by day. They spoke in whispers of Fabien<span class="s2">,</span> the cyclone and<span class="s2">,</span> above all<span class="s2">,</span> of Rivière whom they pictured near at hand and point by point capitulating to this rebuff the elements had dealt.</p>
<p class="p3">Their chatter ceased abruptly<span class="s2">;</span> Rivière was standing at his door<span class="s2">,</span> his overcoat tight-buttoned across his chest<span class="s2">,</span> his hat well down upon his eyes<span class="s2">,</span> like the incessant traveler he always seemed. Calmly he approached the head clerk.</p>
<p class="p3">"It's one ten. Are the papers for the Eu­rope mail in order<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"I — I thought —"</p>
<p class="p3">"Your business is to carry out orders<span class="s2">,</span> not to think."</p>
<p class="p3">Slowly turning away<span class="s2">,</span> he moved toward an open window<span class="s2">,</span> his hands clasped behind his back. A clerk came up to him.</p>
<p class="p3">"We have very few replies<span class="s2">,</span> sir. We hear that a great many telegraph lines in the in­terior have been destroyed."</p>
<p class="p3">"Right!"</p>
<p class="p3">Unmoving<span class="s2">,</span> Rivière stared out into the night.</p>
<p class="p3">Thus each new message boded new peril for the mail. Each town<span class="s2">,</span> when a reply could be sent through before the lines were broken<span class="s2">,</span> announced the cyclone on its way<span class="s2">,</span> like an in­vading horde. "It's coming up from the Cor­dillera<span class="s2">,</span> sweeping everything before it<span class="s2">,</span> toward the sea."</p>
<p class="p3">To Rivière the stars seemed over-bright<span class="s2">,</span> the air too moist. Strange night indeed! It was rotting away in patches<span class="s2">,</span> like the substance of a shining fruit. The stars<span class="s2">,</span> in all their host<span class="s2">,</span> looked down on Buenos Aires — an oasis<span class="s2">,</span> and not to last. A haven out of Fabien's range<span class="s2">,</span> in any case. A night of menace<span class="s2">,</span> touched and tainted by an evil wind. A difficult night to conquer.</p>
<p class="p3">Somewhere in its depths an airplane was in peril<span class="s2">;</span> here<span class="s2">,</span> on the margin<span class="s2">,</span> they were fight­ing to rescue it<span class="s2">,</span> in vain.</p>

<p class="p3">Fabien's Wife Telephoned.</p>
<p class="p3">Fabien's wife telephoned.</p>
<p class="p3">Each night she calculated the progress of the homing Patagonia mail. "He's leaving Trelew now<span class="s2">,</span>" she murmured. Then went to sleep again. Presently: "He's getting near San Antonio<span class="s2">,</span> he has its lights in view." Then she got out of bed<span class="s2">,</span> drew back the curtains and summed up the sky. "All those clouds will worry him." Sometimes the moon was wan­dering like a shepherd and the young wife heartened by the faithful moon and stars<span class="s2">,</span> the thousand presences that watched her hus­band. Toward one o'clock she felt him near her. "Not far to go<span class="s2">,</span> Buenos Aires is in sight." Then she got up again<span class="s2">,</span> prepared a meal for him<span class="s2">,</span> a nice steaming cup of coffee. "It's so cold up there!" She always welcomed him as if he had just descended from a snow-peak. "You must be cold!" "Not a bit." "Well<span class="s2">,</span> warm yourself anyhow!" She had everything ready at a quarter past one. Then she telephoned. Tonight she asked the usual ques­tion.</p>
<p class="p3">"Has Fabien landed<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">The clerk at the other end grew flustered. "Who's speaking<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"Simone Fabien."</p>
<p class="p3">"Ah! A moment<span class="s2">,</span> please. . . ."</p>
<p class="p3">Afraid to answer<span class="s2">,</span> he passed the receiver to the head clerk.</p>
<p class="p3">"Who's that<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"Simone Fabien."</p>
<p class="p3">"Yes. What can I do for you<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"Has my husband arrived<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">After a silence which must have baffled her<span class="s2">,</span> there came a monosyllable. "No."</p>
<p class="p3">"Is he delayed<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"Yes."</p>
<p class="p3">Another silence. "Yes<span class="s2">,</span> he is delayed."</p>
<p class="p3">"Ah!"</p>
<p class="p3">The cry of a wounded creature. A little delay<span class="s2">,</span> that's nothing much<span class="s2">,</span> but when it lasts<span class="s2">,</span> when it lasts. . . .</p>
<p class="p3">"Yes. And when — when is he expected in<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"When is he expected<span class="s2">?</span> We . . . we don't know exactly . . ."</p>
<p class="p3">A solid wall in front of her<span class="s2">,</span> a wall of silence<span class="s2">,</span> which only gave her back the echo of her questions.</p>
<p class="p3">"Do please tell me<span class="s2">,</span> where is he now<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"Where is he<span class="s2">?</span> Wait. . . ."</p>
<p class="p3">This suspense was like a torture. Something was happening there<span class="s2">,</span> behind that wall.</p>
<p class="p3">At last<span class="s2">,</span> a voice! "He left Commodoro at seven thirty this evening."</p>
<p class="p3">"Yes<span class="s2">?</span> And then<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"Then — delayed<span class="s2">,</span> seriously delayed by stormy weather."</p>
<p class="p3">"Ah! A storm!"</p>
<p class="p3">The injustice of it<span class="s2">,</span> the sly cruelty of that moon up there<span class="s2">,</span> that lazing moon of Buenos Aires! Suddenly she remembered that it took barely two hours to fly from Commodoro to Trelew.</p>
<p class="p3">"He's been six hours on the way to Tre­lew! But surely you've had messages from him. What does he say<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"What does he say<span class="s2">?</span> Well<span class="s2">,</span> you see<span class="s2">,</span> with weather like that . . . it's only natural . . . we can't hear him."</p>
<p class="p3">"Weather like — <span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"You may rest assured<span class="s2">,</span> madame<span class="s2">,</span> the mo­ment we get news of him<span class="s2">,</span> we will ring you up."</p>
<p class="p3">"Ah! You've no news."</p>
<p class="p3">"Good-night<span class="s2">,</span> madame."</p>
<p class="p3">"No! No! I want to talk to the director." "I'm sorry<span class="s2">,</span> he's very busy just now<span class="s2">;</span> he has a meeting on — "</p>
<p class="p3">"I can't help that. That doesn't matter. I insist on speaking to him."</p>
<p class="p3">The head clerk mopped his forehead. "A moment<span class="s2">,</span> please."</p>
<p class="p3">He opened Rivière's door.</p>
<p class="p3">"Madame Fabien wants to speak to you<span class="s2">,</span> sir."</p>
<p class="p3">"Here<span class="s2">,</span>" thought Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> "is what I was dreading." The emotional elements of the drama were coming into action. His first im­pulse was to thrust them aside<span class="s2">;</span> mothers and women are not allowed in an operating theater. And all emotion is bidden to hold its peace on a ship in peril<span class="s2">;</span> it does not help to save the crew. Nevertheless he yielded.</p>
<p class="p3">"Switch on to my phone."</p>
<p class="p3">No sooner did he hear that far off<span class="s2">,</span> qua­vering voice<span class="s2">,</span> than he knew his inability to answer it. It would be futile for both alike<span class="s2">,</span> worse than futile<span class="s2">,</span> to meet each other.</p>
<p class="p3">"Do not be alarmed<span class="s2">,</span> madame<span class="s2">,</span> I beg you. In our calling it so often happens that a long while passes without news."</p>
<p class="p3">He had reached a point where not the problem of a small personal grief but the very will to act was in itself at issue. Not so much Fabien's wife as another theory of life confronted Rivière now. Hearing that timid voice<span class="s2">,</span> he could but pity its infinite distress—and know it for an enemy! For action and in­dividual happiness have no truck with each other<span class="s2">;</span> they are eternally at war. This woman<span class="s2">,</span> too<span class="s2">,</span> was championing a self-coherent world with its own rights and duties<span class="s2">,</span> that world where a lamp shines at nightfall on the table<span class="s2">,</span> flesh calls to mated flesh<span class="s2">,</span> a homely world of love and hopes and memories. She stood up for her happiness and she was right. And Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> too<span class="s2">,</span> was right<span class="s2">,</span> yet he found no words to set against this woman's truth. He was discovering the truth within him<span class="s2">,</span> his own inhuman and unutterable truth<span class="s2">,</span> by an humble light<span class="s2">,</span> the lamplight of a little home!</p>
<p class="p3">"Madame . . . !"</p>
<p class="p3">She did not hear him. Her hands were bruised with beating on the wall and she lay fallen<span class="s2">,</span> or so it seemed to him<span class="s2">,</span> almost at his feet.</p>
<p class="p3">One day an engineer had remarked to Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> as they were bending above a wounded man<span class="s2">,</span> beside a bridge that was being erected: "Is the bridge worth a man's crushed face<span class="s2">?</span>" Not one of the peasants using the road would ever have wished to mutilate this face so hideously just to save the extra walk to the next bridge. "The welfare of the commun­ity<span class="s2">,</span>" the engineer had continued<span class="s2">,</span> "is just the sum of individual welfares and has no right to look beyond them." "And yet<span class="s2">,</span>" Rivière observed on a subsequent occasion<span class="s2">,</span> "even though human life may be the most precious thing on earth<span class="s2">,</span> we always behave as if there were something of higher value than human life. . . . But what thing<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">Thinking of the lost airmen<span class="s2">,</span> Rivière felt his heart sink. All man's activity<span class="s2">,</span> even the building of a bridge<span class="s2">,</span> involves a toll of suf­fering and he could no longer evade the is­sue — "Under what authority<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">These men<span class="s2">,</span> he mused<span class="s2">,</span> who perhaps are lost<span class="s2">,</span> might have led happy lives. He seemed to see as in a golden sanctuary the evening lamp­light shine on faces bending side by side. "Under what authority have I taken them from all this<span class="s2">?</span>" he wondered. What was his right to rob them of their personal happiness<span class="s2">?</span> Did not the highest of all laws ordain that these human joys should be safeguarded<span class="s2">?</span> But he destroyed them. And yet one day<span class="s2">,</span> in­evitably<span class="s2">,</span> those golden sanctuaries vanish like mirage. Old age and death<span class="s2">,</span> more pitiless than even he<span class="s2">,</span> destroy them. There is<span class="s2">,</span> perhaps<span class="s2">,</span> some other thing<span class="s2">,</span> something more lasting<span class="s2">,</span> to be saved<span class="s2">;</span> and<span class="s2">,</span> perhaps<span class="s2">,</span> it was to save this part of man that Rivière was working. Other­wise there could be no defense for action.</p>
<p class="p3">To love<span class="s2">,</span> only to love<span class="s2">,</span> leads nowhere. Rivière knew a dark sense of duty<span class="s2">,</span> greater than that of love. And deep within it there might lie another emotion and a tender one<span class="s2">,</span> but worlds away from ordinary feelings. He recalled a phrase that he once had read: "The one thing is to make them everlasting. . . . That which you seek within yourself will die." He remembered a temple of the sun-god<span class="s2">,</span> built by the ancient Incas of Peru. Tall menhirs on a mountain. But for these what would be left of all that mighty civilization which with its massive stones weighs heavy<span class="s2">,</span> like a dark regret<span class="s2">,</span> on modern man<span class="s2">?</span> Under the mandate of what strange love<span class="s2">,</span> what ruth­lessness<span class="s2">,</span> did that primeval leader of men compel his hordes to drag this temple up the mountainside<span class="s2">,</span> bidding them raise up their eternity<span class="s2">?</span> And now another picture rose in Rivière's mind<span class="s2">;</span> the people of the little towns<span class="s2">,</span> strolling by nights around their bandstands. That form of happiness<span class="s2">,</span> those shackles . . . he thought. The leader of those ancient races may have had scant compassion for man's sufferings<span class="s2">,</span> but he had a boundless pity for his death. Not for his personal death<span class="s2">,</span> but pity for his race<span class="s2">,</span> doomed to be blotted out beneath a sea of sand. And so he bade his folk set up these stones at least<span class="s2">,</span> something the desert never would engulf.</p>
<p class="p3">chapter fifteen</p>
<p class="p3">That Scrap of Folded Paper Might Perhaps Save Him Yet</p>
<p class="p3">That scrap of folded paper might perhaps save him yet<span class="s2">;</span> gritting his teeth<span class="s2">,</span> Fabien un­folded it.</p>
<p class="p3">"Impossible communicate Buenos Aires. Can't even touch the key<span class="s2">,</span> the shocks are numbing my hands."</p>
<p class="p3">In his vexation Fabien wanted to reply<span class="s2">,</span> but the moment his hands left the controls to write<span class="s2">,</span> a vast groundswell seemed to surge up across his body<span class="s2">;</span> the eddies lifted him in his five tons of metal and rocked him to and fro. He abandoned the attempt.</p>
<p class="p3">Again he clenched his hands upon the tem­pest and brought it down. Fabien was breath­ing heavily. If that fellow pulled up the aerial for fear of the storm<span class="s2">,</span> Fabien would smash his face in when they landed. At all costs they must get in touch with Buenos Aires — as though across the thousand miles and more a safety-line might be flung to rescue them from this abyss! If he could not have one vagrant ray of light<span class="s2">,</span> not even the flicker of an inn-lamp — of little help indeed<span class="s2">,</span> yet shining like a beacon<span class="s2">,</span> earnest of the earth — at least let him be given a voice<span class="s2">,</span> a single word from that lost world of his. The pilot raised his fist and shook it in the red glow<span class="s2">,</span> hoping to make the man behind him under­stand the tragic truth<span class="s2">,</span> but the other was bend­ing down to watch a world in ruins<span class="s2">,</span> with its buried cities and dead lights<span class="s2">,</span> and did not see him.</p>
<p class="p3">Let them shout any order whatever to him and Fabien would obey. If they tell me to go round and round<span class="s2">,</span> he thought<span class="s2">,</span> I'll turn in circles and if they say I must head due south.</p>
<p class="p3">... For somewhere<span class="s2">,</span> even now<span class="s2">,</span> there still were lands of calm<span class="s2">,</span> at peace beneath the wide moon-shadows. His comrades down there<span class="s2">,</span> om­niscient folk like clever scientists<span class="s2">,</span> knew all about them<span class="s2">,</span> poring upon the maps beneath their hanging lamps<span class="s2">,</span> pretty as flower-bells. But he<span class="s2">,</span> what could he know save squalls and night<span class="s2">,</span> this night that buffeted him with its swirling spate of darkness<span class="s2">?</span> Surely they could not leave two men to their fate in these whirl­winds and flaming clouds! No<span class="s2">,</span> that was un­thinkable! They might order Fabien to set his course at two hundred and forty degrees<span class="s2">,</span> and he would do it. . . . But he was alone.</p>
<p class="p3">It was as if dead matter were infected by his exasperation<span class="s2">;</span> at every plunge the engine set up such furious vibrations that all the fuselage seemed convulsed with rage. Fabien strained all his efforts to control it<span class="s2">;</span> crouch­ing in the cockpit<span class="s2">,</span> he kept his eyes fixed on the artificial horizon only<span class="s2">,</span> for the masses of sky and land outside were not to be distin­guished<span class="s2">,</span> lost both alike in a welter as of worlds in the making. But the hands of the flying instruments oscillated more and more abruptly<span class="s2">,</span> grew almost impossible to follow. Already the pilot<span class="s2">,</span> misled by their vagaries<span class="s2">,</span> was losing altitude<span class="s2">,</span> fighting against odds<span class="s2">,</span> while deadly quicksands sucked him down into the darkness. He read his height<span class="s2">,</span> sixteen hundred — just the level of the hills. He guessed their towering billows hard upon him<span class="s2">,</span> for now it seemed that all these earthen monsters<span class="s2">,</span> the least of which could crush him into nothingness<span class="s2">,</span> were breaking loose from their foundations and careering about in a drunken frenzy. A dark tellurian carnival was thronging close and closer round him.</p>
<p class="p3">He made up his mind. He would land no matter where<span class="s2">,</span> even if it meant cracking up! To avoid the hills anyhow<span class="s2">,</span> he launched his only landing flare. It sputtered and spun<span class="s2">,</span> il­lumining a vast plain<span class="s2">,</span> then died away<span class="s2">;</span> be­neath him lay the sea!</p>
<p class="p3">His thoughts came quickly. Lost — forty degrees' drift — yes<span class="s2">,</span> I've drifted<span class="s2">,</span> sure enough — it's a cyclone — where's land<span class="s2">?</span> He turned due west. Without another flare<span class="s2">,</span> he thought<span class="s2">,</span> I'm a goner. Well<span class="s2">,</span> it was bound to happen one day. And that fellow behind there! Sure thing he's pulled up the aerial. . . . But now the pilot's anger had ebbed away. He had only to unclasp his hands and their lives would slither through his fingers like a trivial mote of dust. He held the beating heart of each — his own<span class="s2">,</span> his comrade's — in his hands. And suddenly his hands appalled him.</p>
<p class="p3">In these squalls that battered on the plane<span class="s2">,</span> to counteract the jerks of the wheel<span class="s2">,</span> which else would have snapped the control cables<span class="s2">,</span> he clung to it with might and main<span class="s2">,</span> never relaxing his hold for an instant. But now he could no longer feel his hands<span class="s2">,</span> numbed by the strain. He tried to shift his fingers and get some signal they were there<span class="s2">,</span> but he could not tell if they obeyed his will. His arms seemed to end in two queer foreign bodies<span class="s2">,</span> insentient like flabby rubber pads. "Better try hard to think I'm gripping<span class="s2">,</span>" he said to himself. But whether his thought carried as far as his hands he could not guess. The tugs upon the wheel were only felt by him as sudden twinges in his shoulders. "I'll let go for sure. My fingers will open." His rashness scared him — that he dared to even think such words! — for now he fancied that his hands<span class="s2">,</span> yielding to the dark suggestion of his thought<span class="s2">,</span> were opening slowly<span class="s2">,</span> slowly opening in the shadow<span class="s2">,</span> to betray him.</p>
<p class="p3">He might keep up the struggle<span class="s2">,</span> chance his luck<span class="s2">;</span> no destiny attacks us from outside. But<span class="s2">,</span> within him<span class="s2">,</span> man bears his fate and there comes a moment when he knows himself vulnerable<span class="s2">;</span> and then<span class="s2">,</span> as in a vertigo<span class="s2">,</span> blunder upon blunder lures him.</p>
<p class="p3">And<span class="s2">,</span> at this very moment<span class="s2">,</span> there gleamed above his head<span class="s2">,</span> across a storm-rift<span class="s2">,</span> like a fatal lure within a deep abyss<span class="s2">,</span> a star or two.</p>
<p class="p3">Only too well he knew them for a trap. A man sees a few stars at the issue of a pit and climbs toward them<span class="s2">,</span> and then—never can he get down again but stays up there eternally<span class="s2">,</span> chewing the stars. . . .</p>
<p class="p3">But such was his lust for light that he be­gan to climb.</p>
<p class="p3">chapter sixteen</p>
<p class="p3">He Climbed and It Grew Easier To Correct The Plunges —</p>
<p class="p3">He climbed and it grew easier to correct the plunges for the stars gave him his bearings. Their pale magnet drew him up<span class="s2">;</span> after that long and bitter quest for light<span class="s2">,</span> for nothing in the world would he forgo the frailest gleam. If the glimmer of a little inn were all his riches<span class="s2">,</span> he would turn around this token of his heart's desire until his death! So now he soared toward the fields of light.</p>
<p class="p3">Little by little he spiraled up<span class="s2">,</span> out of the dark pit which closed again beneath him. As he rose the clouds began to shed their slime of shadow<span class="s2">,</span> flowing past him in cleaner<span class="s2">,</span> whiter billows. Fabien rose clear.</p>
<p class="p3">And now a wonder seized him<span class="s2">;</span> dazzled by that brightness<span class="s2">,</span> he had to keep his eyes closed for some seconds. He had never dreamt the night-clouds could dazzle thus. But the full moon and all the constellations were chang­ing them to waves of light.</p>
<p class="p3">In a flash<span class="s2">,</span> the very instant he had risen clear<span class="s2">,</span> the pilot found a peace that passed his understanding. Not a ripple tilted the plane but<span class="s2">,</span> like a ship that has crossed the bar<span class="s2">,</span> it moved across a tranquil anchorage. In an un­known and secret corner of the sky it floated<span class="s2">,</span> as in a harbor of the Happy Isles. Below him still the storm was fashioning another world<span class="s2">,</span> thridded with squalls and cloudbursts and lightnings<span class="s2">,</span> but turning to the stars a face of crystal snow.</p>
<p class="p3">Now all grew luminous<span class="s2">,</span> his hands<span class="s2">,</span> his clothes<span class="s2">,</span> the wings<span class="s2">,</span> and Fabien thought that he was in a limbo of strange magic<span class="s2">;</span> for the light did not come down from the stars but welled up from below<span class="s2">,</span> from all that snowy whiteness.</p>
<p class="p3">The clouds beneath threw up the flakes the moon was pouring on them<span class="s2">;</span> on every hand they loomed like towers of snow. A milky stream of light flowed everywhere<span class="s2">,</span> lav­ing the plane and crew. When Fabien turned he saw the wireless operator smile.</p>
<p class="p3">"That's better!" he cried.</p>
<p class="p3">But his words were drowned by the rumor of the flight<span class="s2">;</span> they conversed in smiles. I'm daft<span class="s2">,</span> thought Fabien<span class="s2">,</span> to be smiling<span class="s2">,</span> we're lost.</p>
<p class="p3">And yet — at last a myriad dark arms had let him go<span class="s2">;</span> those bonds of his were loosed<span class="s2">,</span> as of a prisoner whom they let walk a while in liberty amongst the flowers.</p>
<p class="p3">"Too beautiful<span class="s2">,</span>" he thought. Amid the far-flung treasure of the stars he roved<span class="s2">,</span> in a world where no life was<span class="s2">,</span> no faintest breath of life<span class="s2">,</span> save his and his companion's. Like plunderers of fabled cities they seemed<span class="s2">,</span> immured in treasure-vaults whence there is no escape. Amongst these frozen jewels they were wandering<span class="s2">,</span> rich beyond all dreams<span class="s2">,</span> but doomed.</p>
<p class="p3">chapter seventeen</p>
<p class="p3">One of the Wireless Operators at the Commodoro Rivadavia Station —</p>
<p class="p3">One of the wireless operators at the Corn­modoro Rivadavia station in Patagonia made a startled gesture and all the others keeping helpless vigil there crowded round to read the message.</p>
<p class="p3">A harsh light fell upon the blank sheet of paper over which they bent. The operator's hand seemed loath to do its task and his pencil shook. The words to write were prisoned in his hand<span class="s2">,</span> but already his fingers twitched.</p>
<p class="p3">"Storms<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">He nodded assent<span class="s2">;</span> he could hardly hear for interferences. Then he scrawled some illegi­ble signs<span class="s2">,</span> then words<span class="s2">;</span> then<span class="s2">,</span> at last<span class="s2">,</span> the text came out.</p>
<p class="p3">"Cut off at 12<span class="s2">,</span>000 feet<span class="s2">,</span> above the storm. Proceeding due west toward interior<span class="s2">;</span> found we had been carried above sea. No visibility below. Impossible know if still flying over sea. Report if storm extends interior."</p>
<p class="p3">By reason of the storms the telegram had to be relayed from post to post to Buenos Aires<span class="s2">,</span> bearing its message through the night like bale-fires lit from tower to tower.</p>
<p class="p3">Buenos Aires transmitted a reply. "Storm covers all interior area. How much gasoline left<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"For thirty minutes." These words sped back from post to post to Buenos Aires.</p>
<p class="p3">In under half an hour the plane was doomed to plunge into a cyclone which would crash it to the earth.</p>

<p class="p3">Rivire Was Musing<span class="s2">,</span> All Hope Lost –</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière was musing<span class="s2">,</span> all hope lost<span class="s2">;</span> some­where this plane would founder in the dark­ness. A picture rose in his mind of a scene which had impressed him in his boyhood<span class="s2">;</span> a pond that was being emptied to find a body. Thus<span class="s2">,</span> till this flood of darkness had been drained off the earth and daylight turned toward the plains and cornfields<span class="s2">,</span> noth­ing would be found. Then some humble peasants perhaps would come on two young bodies<span class="s2">,</span> their elbows folded on their faces<span class="s2">,</span> like children asleep amid the grass and gold of some calm scene. Drowned by the night.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière thought of all the treasure buried in the depths of night<span class="s2">,</span> as in deep<span class="s2">,</span> legendary seas. Night's apple-trees that wait upon the dawn with all their flowers that serve as yet no purpose. Night<span class="s2">,</span> perfume-laden<span class="s2">,</span> that hidesthe lambs asleep and flowers that have no color yet.</p>
<p class="p3">Little by little the lush tilth<span class="s2">,</span> wet woods<span class="s2">,</span> and dew-cool meadows would swing toward the light. But somewhere in the hills<span class="s2">,</span> no longer dark with menace<span class="s2">,</span> amid the fields and flocks<span class="s2">,</span> a world at peace again<span class="s2">,</span> two children would seem to sleep. And something would have flowed out of the seen world into that other.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière knew all the tenderness of Fabien's wife<span class="s2">,</span> the fears that haunted her<span class="s2">;</span> this love seemed only lent her for a while<span class="s2">,</span> like a toy to some poor child. He thought of Fabien's hand which<span class="s2">,</span> firm on the controls<span class="s2">,</span> would hold the balance of his fate some minutes yet<span class="s2">;</span> that hand had given caresses and lingered on a breast<span class="s2">,</span> wakening a tumult there<span class="s2">;</span> a hand of godlike virtue<span class="s2">,</span> it had touched a face<span class="s2">,</span> trans­figuring it. A hand that brought miracles to pass.</p>
<p class="p3">Fabien was drifting now in the vast splen­dor of a sea of clouds<span class="s2">,</span> but under him there lay eternity. Among the constellations still he had his being<span class="s2">,</span> their only denizen. For yet a while he held the universe in his hand<span class="s2">,</span> weighed it at his breast. That wheel he clutched upbore a load of human treasure and desperately<span class="s2">,</span> from one star to the other<span class="s2">,</span> he trafficked this useless wealth<span class="s2">,</span> soon to be his no more.</p>
<p class="p3">A single radio post still heard him. The only link between him and the world was a wave of music<span class="s2">,</span> a minor modulation. Not a lament<span class="s2">,</span> no cry<span class="s2">,</span> yet purest of sounds that ever spoke despair.</p>
<p class="p3">chapter nineteen</p>
<p class="p3">Robineau Broke In Upon His Thoughts.</p>
<p class="p3">Robineau broke in upon his thoughts.</p>
<p class="p3">"I've been thinking<span class="s2">,</span> sir. . . . Perhaps we might try — "</p>
<p class="p3">He had nothing really to suggest but thus proclaimed his good intentions. A solution<span class="s2">,</span> how he would have rejoiced to find it! He went about it as if it were a puzzle to be solved. Solutions were his forte<span class="s2">,</span> but Rivière would not hear of them. "I tell you<span class="s2">,</span> Robi­neau<span class="s2">,</span> in life there are no solutions. There are only motive forces<span class="s2">,</span> and our task is to set them acting — then the solutions follow." The only force that Robineau had to activate was one which functioned in the mechanics' shop<span class="s2">,</span> a humble force which saved propeller-bosses from rusting.</p>
<p class="p3">But this night's happenings found Robi­neau at fault. His inspectorial mandate could not control the elements<span class="s2">,</span> nor yet a phantom ship that<span class="s2">,</span> as things were<span class="s2">,</span> struggled no longer to win a punctuality-bonus but only to evade a penalty which canceled all that Robineau imposed<span class="s2">,</span> the penalty of death.</p>
<p class="p3">There was no use for Robineau now and he roamed the offices<span class="s2">,</span> forlorn.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière was informed that Fabien's wife wished to see him. Tormented by anxiety<span class="s2">,</span> she was waiting in the clerk's office till Rivière could receive her. The employees were steal­ing glances at her face. She felt shy<span class="s2">,</span> almost shamefast<span class="s2">,</span> and gazed nervously around her<span class="s2">;</span> she had no right of presence here. They went about their tasks as usual and to her it was as if they were trampling on a corpse<span class="s2">;</span> in their ledgers no human sorrow but dwindled to dross of brittle figures. She looked for some­thing that might speak to her of Fabien<span class="s2">;</span> at home all things confessed his absence — the sheets turned back upon the bed<span class="s2">,</span> the coffee on the table<span class="s2">,</span> a vase of flowers. Here there was nothing of him<span class="s2">;</span> all was at war with pity<span class="s2">,</span> friendship<span class="s2">,</span> memories. The only word she caught <span class="s2">(</span>for in her presence they instinctively lowered their voices<span class="s2">)</span> was the oath of an em­ployee clamoring for an invoice. "The dyna­mo account<span class="s2">,</span> God blast you! The one we send to Santos." Raising her eyes she gazed toward this man with a look of infinite wonder. Then to the wall where a map hung. Her lips trembled a little<span class="s2">,</span> almost imperceptibly.</p>
<p class="p3">The realization irked her that in this room she was the envoy of a hostile creed and almost she regretted having come<span class="s2">;</span> she would have liked to hide somewhere and<span class="s2">,</span> fearful of being remarked<span class="s2">,</span> dared neither cough nor weep. She felt her presence here misplaced<span class="s2">,</span> indecent<span class="s2">,</span> as though she were standing naked before them. But so potent was her truth<span class="s2">,</span> the truth within her<span class="s2">,</span> that furtively their eyes strayed ever and again in her direction<span class="s2">,</span> trying to read it on her face. Beauty was hers and she stood for a holy thing<span class="s2">,</span> the world of human happiness. She vouched for the sanctity of that material something with which man tampers when he acts. She closed her eyes before their crowded scrutiny<span class="s2">,</span> revealing all the peace which in his blindness man is apt to shatter.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière admitted her.</p>
<p class="p3">So now she was come to make a timid plea for her flowers<span class="s2">,</span> the coffee waiting on the table<span class="s2">,</span> her own young body. Again<span class="s2">,</span> in this room<span class="s2">,</span> colder even than the others<span class="s2">,</span> her lips began to quiver. Thus<span class="s2">,</span> too<span class="s2">,</span> she bore witness to her truth<span class="s2">,</span> unutterable in this alien world. All the wild yearning of her love<span class="s2">,</span> her heart's devo­tion<span class="s2">,</span> seemed here invested with a selfish<span class="s2">,</span> pes­tering aspect. And again she would have liked to leave this place.</p>
<p class="p3">"I am disturbing you — "</p>
<p class="p3">"No<span class="s2">,</span>" said Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> "you are not disturbing me. But unfortunately neither you nor I can do anything except — wait."</p>
<p class="p3">There was a faint movement of her shoul­ders and Rivière guessed its meaning. "What is the use of that lamp<span class="s2">,</span> the dinner waiting<span class="s2">,</span> and the flowers there when I return<span class="s2">?</span>" Once a young mother confided in Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> "I've hardly realized my baby's death as yet. It's the little things that are so cruel — when I see the baby-clothes I had ready<span class="s2">,</span> when I wake up at night and there rises in my heart a tide of love<span class="s2">,</span> useless now<span class="s2">,</span> like my milk . . . all useless!" And for this woman here<span class="s2">,</span> Fabien's death would only just begin to-morrow — in every action<span class="s2">,</span> useless now in trivial objects . . . use­less. Little by little Fabien would leave his home. A deep<span class="s2">,</span> unuttered pity stirred in Rivière's heart.</p>
<p class="p3">"Madame — "</p>
<p class="p3">The young wife turned and left him with a weak smile<span class="s2">,</span> an almost humble smile<span class="s2">,</span> ignor­ing her own power.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière sat down again rather heavily. "Still she is helping me to discover the thing I'm looking for."</p>
<p class="p3">He fingered absent-mindedly the messages from the northern airports. "We do not pray for immortality<span class="s2">,</span>" he thought<span class="s2">,</span> "but only not to see our acts and all things stripped sud­denly of all their meaning<span class="s2">;</span> for then it is the utter emptiness of everything reveals itself."</p>
<p class="p3">His gaze fell on the telegrams.</p>
<p class="p3">"These are the paths death takes to enter here — messages that have lost their meaning."</p>
<p class="p3">He looked at Robineau. Meaningless<span class="s2">,</span> too<span class="s2">,</span> this fellow who served no purpose now. Rivière addressed him almost gruffly.</p>
<p class="p3">"Have I got to tell you what your duties are<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">Then he pushed open the door that led into the Business Office and saw how Fabien's dis­appearance was recorded there in signs his wife could not have noticed. The slip marked R.B.903<span class="s2">,</span> Fabien's machine<span class="s2">,</span> was already in­serted in the wall-index of Unavailable Plant. The clerks preparing the papers for the Eu­rope mail were working slackly<span class="s2">,</span> knowing it would be delayed. The airport was ringing up for orders respecting the staff on night duty whose presence was no longer necessary. The functions of life were slowing down. That is death! thought Rivière. His work was like a sailing-ship becalmed upon the sea.</p>
<p class="p3">He heard Robineau speaking. "Sir<span class="s2">,</span> they had only been married six weeks."</p>
<p class="p3">"Get on with your work!"</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> watching the clerks<span class="s2">,</span> seemed to see beyond them the workmen<span class="s2">,</span> mechanics<span class="s2">,</span> pilots<span class="s2">,</span> all who had helped him in his task<span class="s2">,</span> with the faith of men who build. He thought of those little cities of old time where men had mur­mured of the "Indies<span class="s2">,</span>" built a ship and freighted it with hopes. That men might see their hope outspread its wings across the sea. All of them magnified<span class="s2">,</span> lifted above them­selves and saved — by a ship! He thought: The goal<span class="s2">,</span> perhaps<span class="s2">,</span> means nothing<span class="s2">,</span> it is the thing done that delivers man from death. By their ship those men will live.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> too<span class="s2">,</span> would be fighting against death when he restored to those telegrams their full meaning<span class="s2">,</span> to these men on night duty their unrest and to his pilots their tragic purpose<span class="s2">;</span> when life itself would make his work alive again<span class="s2">,</span> as winds restore to life a sailing-ship upon the sea.</p>
<p class="p3">chapter twenty</p>
<p class="p3">Commodoro Rivadavia Could Hear Nothing Now</p>
<p class="p3">Commodoro Rivadavia could hear nothing now<span class="s2">,</span> but twenty seconds later<span class="s2">,</span> six hundred miles away<span class="s2">,</span> Bahia Blanca picked up a second message.</p>
<p class="p3">"Coming down. Entering the clouds. . . ." Then two words of a blurred message were caught at Trelew.</p>
<p class="p3">". . . see nothing . . ."</p>
<p class="p3">Short waves are like that<span class="s2">;</span> here they can be caught<span class="s2">,</span> elsewhere is silence. Then<span class="s2">,</span> for no rea­son<span class="s2">,</span> all is changed. This crew<span class="s2">,</span> whose position was unknown<span class="s2">,</span> made itself heard by living ears<span class="s2">,</span> from somewhere out of space and out of time<span class="s2">,</span> and at the radio station phantom hands were tracing a word or two on this white paper.</p>
<p class="p3">Had the fuel run out already or was the pilot<span class="s2">,</span> before catastrophe<span class="s2">,</span> playing his last card: to reach the earth again without a crash<span class="s2">?</span></p>
<p class="p3">Buenos Aires transmitted an order to Tre­lew.</p>
<p class="p3">"Ask him."</p>
<p class="p3">The radio station looked like a laboratory with its nickel and its copper<span class="s2">,</span> manometers and sheaves of wires. The operators on duty in their white overalls seemed to be bending silently above some simple experiment. Deli­cately they touched their instruments<span class="s2">,</span> explor­ing the magnetic sky<span class="s2">,</span> dowsers in quest of hidden gold.</p>
<p class="p3">"No answer<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"No answer."</p>
<p class="p3">Perhaps they yet might seize upon its way a sound that told of life. If the plane and its lights were soaring up to join the stars<span class="s2">,</span> it might be they would hear a sound—a singing star!</p>
<p class="p3">The seconds flowed away<span class="s2">,</span> like ebbing blood. Were they still in flight<span class="s2">?</span> Each second killed a hope. The stream of time was wear­ing life away. As for twenty centuries it beats against a temple<span class="s2">,</span> seeping through the granite<span class="s2">,</span> and spreads the fane in ruin<span class="s2">,</span> so centuries of wear and tear were thronging in each second<span class="s2">,</span> menacing the airmen.</p>
<p class="p3">Every second swept something away<span class="s2">;</span> Fabien's voice<span class="s2">,</span> his laugh<span class="s2">,</span> his smile. Silence was gaining ground. Heavy and heavier silence drowned their voices<span class="s2">,</span> like a heavy sea.</p>
<p class="p3">"One forty<span class="s2">,</span>" some one murmured. "They're out of fuel. They can't be flying any more."</p>
<p class="p3">Then silence.</p>
<p class="p3">A dry and bitter taste rose on their lips<span class="s2">,</span> like the dry savor of a journey's end. Some­thing mysterious<span class="s2">,</span> a sickening thing<span class="s2">,</span> had come to pass. And all the shining nickel and trel­lised copper seemed tarnished with the gloom that broods on ruined factories. All this ap­paratus had grown clumsy<span class="s2">,</span> futile<span class="s2">,</span> out of use<span class="s2">;</span> a tangle of dead twigs.</p>
<p class="p3">One thing remained<span class="s2">;</span> to wait for daybreak. In a few hours all Argentina would swing to­ward the sun<span class="s2">,</span> and here these men were stand­ing<span class="s2">,</span> as on a beach<span class="s2">,</span> facing the net that was being slowly<span class="s2">,</span> slowly drawn in toward them<span class="s2">,</span> none knowing what its take would be.</p>
<p class="p3">To Rivière in his office came that quiet aftermath which follows only on great dis­asters<span class="s2">,</span> when destiny has spent its force. He had set the police of the entire country on the alert. He could do no more<span class="s2">;</span> only wait.</p>
<p class="p3">But even in the house of death order must have its due. Rivière signed to Robineau.</p>
<p class="p3">"Circular telegram to the northern air­ports. <span class="s2">‘</span>Considerable delay anticipated Patagonia mail. To avoid undue delay Europe mail<span class="s2">,</span> will ship Patagonia traffic on follow­ing Europe mail.<span class="s2">’</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">He stooped a little forward. Then<span class="s2">,</span> with an effort<span class="s2">,</span> he called something to mind<span class="s2">,</span> some­thing important. Yes<span class="s2">,</span> that was it. Better make sure.</p>
<p class="p3">"Robineaul"</p>
<p class="p3">"Sir."</p>
<p class="p3">"Issue an order<span class="s2">,</span> please. Pilots forbidden to exceed 1900 revs. They're ruining my en­gines."</p>
<p class="p3">"Very good<span class="s2">,</span> sir."</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière bowed his head a little more. To be alone—that was his supreme desire.</p>
<p class="p3">"That's all<span class="s2">,</span> Robineau. Trot off<span class="s2">,</span> old chap!"</p>
<p class="p3">And this<span class="s2">,</span> their strange equality before the shades<span class="s2">,</span> filled Robineau with awe.</p>
<p class="p3">chapter twenty-one</p>
<p class="p3">Robineau Was Drifting Aimlessly About The Office.</p>
<p class="p3">Robineau was drifting aimlessly about the office. He felt despondent. The company's life had come to a standstill<span class="s2">,</span> since the Europe mail<span class="s2">,</span> due to start at two<span class="s2">,</span> would be counter­manded and only leave at daybreak. Morosely the employees kept their posts<span class="s2">,</span> but their pres­ence now was purposeless. In steady rhythm the weather reports from the north poured in<span class="s2">,</span> but their "no wind<span class="s2">,</span>" "clear sky<span class="s2">,</span>" "full moon" evoked the vision of a barren king­dom. A wilderness of stones and moonlight. As Robineau<span class="s2">,</span> hardly aware what he was up to<span class="s2">,</span> was turning over the pages of a file on which the office superintendent was at work<span class="s2">,</span> he sud­denly grew conscious that the official in ques­tion was at his side<span class="s2">,</span> waiting with an air of mocking deference to get his papers back. As if he were saying: "That's my show. Suppose you leave me to it<span class="s2">,</span> eh<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">Shocked though he was by his subordi­nate's demeanor<span class="s2">,</span> the inspector found himself tongue-tied and<span class="s2">,</span> with a movement of annoy­ance<span class="s2">,</span> handed back the documents. The super­intendent resumed his seat with an air of grand punctilio. "I should have told him to go to the devil<span class="s2">,</span>" thought Robineau. Then<span class="s2">,</span> to save his face<span class="s2">,</span> he moved away and his thoughts returned to the night's tragedy. For with this tragedy all his chief's campaign went under and Robineau lamented a twofold loss.</p>
<p class="p3">The picture of Rivière alone there in his private office rose in Robineau's mind<span class="s2">;</span> "old chap<span class="s2">,</span>" Rivière had said. Never had there been a man so utterly unfriended as he<span class="s2">,</span> and Robineau felt an infinite compassion for him. He turned over in his mind vague sentences that hinted sympathy and consolation<span class="s2">,</span> and the impulse prompting him struck Robineau as eminently laudable. He knocked gently at the door. There was no answer. Not daring in such a silence to knock louder<span class="s2">,</span> he turned the handle. Rivière was there. For the first time Robineau entered Rivière's room almost on an equal footing<span class="s2">,</span> almost as a friend<span class="s2">;</span> he likened himself to the N.C.O. who joins his wounded general under fire<span class="s2">,</span> follows him in defeat and<span class="s2">,</span> in exile<span class="s2">,</span> plays a brother's part. "Whatever happens I am with you" — that was Robineau's unspoken message.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière said nothing<span class="s2">;</span> his head was bowed and he was staring at his hands. Robineau's courage ebbed and he dared not speak<span class="s2">;</span> the old lion daunted him<span class="s2">,</span> even in defeat. Phrases of loyalty<span class="s2">,</span> of ever-growing fervor<span class="s2">,</span> rose to his lips<span class="s2">;</span> but every time he raised his eyes they encountered that bent head<span class="s2">,</span> gray hair and lips tight-set upon their bitter secret. At last he summoned up his courage.</p>
<p class="p3">"Sir!"</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière raised his head and looked at him. So deep<span class="s2">,</span> so far away had been his dream that till now he might well have been unconscious of Robineau's presence there. And what he felt<span class="s2">,</span> what was that dream and what his heart's bereavement<span class="s2">,</span> none would ever know. . . . For a long while Rivière looked at Robineau as at the living witness of some dark event. Robineau felt ill at ease. An enigmatic irony seemed to shape itself on his chief's lips as he watched Robineau. And the longer his chief watched him<span class="s2">,</span> the more deeply Robineau blushed and the more it grew on Rivière that this fellow had come<span class="s2">,</span> for all his touching and unhappily sincere good-will<span class="s2">,</span> to act as spokes­man for the folly of the herd.</p>
<p class="p3">Robineau by now had quite lost his bear­ings. The N.C.O.<span class="s2">,</span> the general<span class="s2">,</span> the bullets—all faded into mist. Something inexplicable was in the air. Rivière's eyes were still intent on him. Reluctantly he shifted his position<span class="s2">,</span> withdrew his hand from his pocket. Rivière's eyes were on him still. At last<span class="s2">,</span> hardly knowing what he said<span class="s2">,</span> he stammered a few words.</p>
<p class="p3">"I've come for orders<span class="s2">,</span> sir."</p>
<p class="p3">Composedly Rivière pulled out his watch. "It is two. The Asuncion mail will land at two ten. See that the Europe mail takes off at two fifteen."</p>
<p class="p3">Robineau bruited abroad the astounding news<span class="s2">;</span> the night flights would continue. He accosted the office superintendent.</p>
<p class="p3">"Bring me that file of yours to check." The superintendent brought the papers. "Wait!"</p>
<p class="p3">And the superintendent waited.</p>
<p class="p3">chapter twenty-two</p>
<p class="p3">The Asuncion Mail Signaled That It Was About To Land.</p>
<p class="p3">The Asuncion mail signaled that it was about to land. Even at the darkest hour<span class="s2">,</span> Rivière had followed<span class="s2">,</span> telegram by telegram<span class="s2">,</span> its well-ordered progress. In the turmoil of this night he hailed it as the avenger of his faith<span class="s2">,</span> an all-conclusive witness. Each mes­sage telling of this auspicious flight augured a thousand more such flights to come. "And<span class="s2">,</span> after all<span class="s2">,</span>" thought Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> "we don't get a cyclone every night! Once the trail is blazed<span class="s2">,</span> it must be followed up."</p>
<p class="p3">Coming down<span class="s2">,</span> flight by flight<span class="s2">,</span> from Para­guay<span class="s2">,</span> as from an enchanted garden set with flowers<span class="s2">,</span> low houses and slow waters<span class="s2">,</span> the pilot had just skirted the edge of a cyclone which never masked from him a single star. Nine passengers<span class="s2">,</span> huddled in their traveling rugs<span class="s2">,</span> had pressed their foreheads on the window<span class="s2">,</span> as if it were a shop-front glittering with gems.</p>
<p class="p3">For now the little towns of Argentina were stringing through the night their golden beads<span class="s2">,</span> beneath the paler gold of the star-cities. And at his prow the pilot held within his hands his freight of lives<span class="s2">,</span> eyes wide open<span class="s2">,</span> full of moonlight<span class="s2">,</span> like a shepherd. Already Buenos Aires was dyeing the horizon with pink fires<span class="s2">,</span> soon to flaunt its diadem of jewels<span class="s2">,</span> like some fairy hoard. The wireless operator strummed with nimble fingers the final tele­grams<span class="s2">,</span> last notes of a sonata he had played al­legro in the sky—a melody familiar to Rivière's ears. Then he pulled up the aerial and stretched his limbs<span class="s2">,</span> yawning and smiling<span class="s2">;</span> an­other journey done.</p>
<p class="p3">The pilot who had just made land greeted the pilot of the Europe mail<span class="s2">,</span> who was lolling<span class="s2">,</span> his hands in his pockets<span class="s2">,</span> against the plane.</p>
<p class="p3">"Your turn to carry on<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"Yes."</p>
<p class="p3">"Has the Patagonia come in<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"We don't expect it<span class="s2">;</span> lost. How's the weather<span class="s2">?</span> Fine<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"Very fine. Is Fabien lost then<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">They spoke few words of him<span class="s2">,</span> for that deep fraternity of theirs dispensed with phrases.</p>
<p class="p3">The transit mail-bags from Asuncion were loaded into the Europe mail while the pilot<span class="s2">,</span> his head bent back and shoulders pressed against the cockpit<span class="s2">,</span> stood motionless<span class="s2">,</span> watching the stars. He felt a vast power stirring in him and a potent joy.</p>
<p class="p3">"Loaded<span class="s2">?</span>" some one asked. "Then<span class="s2">,</span> con­tact!"</p>
<p class="p3">The pilot did not move. His engine was started. Now he would feel in his shoulders that pressed upon it the airplane come to life. At last<span class="s2">,</span> after all those false alarms—to start or not to start—his mind was easy. His lips were parted and in the moon his keen white teeth glittered like a jungle cub's.</p>
<p class="p3">"Watch out! The night<span class="s2">,</span> you know . . . !"</p>
<p class="p3">He did not hear his comrade's warning. His hands thrust in his pockets and head bent back<span class="s2">,</span> he stared toward the clouds<span class="s2">,</span> mountains and seas and rivers<span class="s2">,</span> and laughed silently. Soft laughter that rustled through him like a breeze across a tree<span class="s2">,</span> and all his body thrilled with it. Soft laughter<span class="s2">,</span> yet stronger<span class="s2">,</span> stronger far<span class="s2">,</span> than all those clouds and mountains<span class="s2">,</span> seas and rivers.</p>
<p class="p3">"What's the joke<span class="s2">?</span>"</p>
<p class="p3">"It's that damned fool Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> who said . . . who thinks I've got the wind up!"</p>
<p class="p3">chapter twenty-three</p>
<p class="p3">In A Minute He Would Be Leaving Buenos Aires —</p>
<p class="p3">In a minute he would be leaving Buenos Aires and Rivière<span class="s2">,</span> on active service once again<span class="s2">,</span> wanted to hear him go. To hear his thunder rise and swell and die into the dis­tance like the tramp of armies marching in the stars.</p>
<p class="p3">With folded arms Rivière passed among the clerks and halted at a window to muse and listen. If he had held up even one de­parture<span class="s2">,</span> that would be an end of night flights. But<span class="s2">,</span> by launching this other mail into the darkness<span class="s2">,</span> Rivière had forestalled the weak­lings who to-morrow would disclaim him.</p>
<p class="p3">Victory<span class="s2">,</span> defeat—the words were meaning­less. Life lies behind these symbols and life is ever bringing new symbols into being. One nation is weakened by victory<span class="s2">,</span> another finds new forces in defeat. Tonight's defeat con­veyed perhaps a lesson which would speed the coming of final victory. The work in progress was all that mattered.</p>
<p class="p3">Within five minutes the radio stations would broadcast the news along the line and across a thousand miles the vibrant force of life give pause to every problem.</p>
<p class="p3">Already a deep organ-note was booming<span class="s2">;</span> the plane.</p>
<p class="p3">Rivière went back to his work and<span class="s2">,</span> as he passed<span class="s2">,</span> the clerks quailed under his stern eyes<span class="s2">;</span> Rivière the Great<span class="s2">,</span> Rivière the Con­queror<span class="s2">,</span> bearing his heavy load of victory.</p>
